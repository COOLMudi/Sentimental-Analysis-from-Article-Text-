1,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/impacts-of-covid-19-on-vegetable-vendors-and-food-stalls/,Impacts of COVID 19 on Food products - Blackcoffer Insights,"some vendors (fruit and vegetable sellers) began venturing out after a few days without explicit permission and immediately faced police harassment. after a few weeks, the government eased restrictions and essential vendors werebeing permitted to vend(due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks). however, the cost of doing business, as well as the risk, has gone up significantly, with vendors not having access to wholesale markets and suppliers and having to spend more on travel costs due to travel restrictions in place in the city. also, with the lockdown still partially in place, the number of buyers has gone down and so have earnings. due to the harsh summer heat, perishable fruits and vegetables also have a reduced shelf life so vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have.the state has recently announced astimulus package of inr 5000 crore for nearly 50 lakh vendors, acknowledging the grave impact of their loss of livelihood. the intended relief for vendors will be a credit loan that will provide an initial working capital of inr 10,000 for all vendors, but this is not sufficient. instead of credit, the government should think of converting it into direct income benefit, a cash grant, as livelihood support to start the income activity regularly. the vendors need income support to be able to restart work, and if they are not able to do so, how will they return the loan. in the face of the ever-changing crisis, vendor organizations have to step forward and advocate for vendors to be provided the resources they need to be able to resume their livelihoods. to this end, vendors organizations could consider the following for an advocacy agenda:livelihood promotion for all vendors, including those selling non-essential goods: the impact of covid-19 has been very harsh on informal workers who have exhausted their capital and earnings in trying to feed themselves during the extended lockdown period. vendors need to be able to resume vending for survival and the government should take steps to begin to reopen markets and allow vendors back on the streets.reopening of markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene: delhi has many different types of traditionally crowded markets including weekly markets (for fresh food, cooked food and essential household items) and daily markets that operate on the sides of roads. these markets will need to resume keeping in mind the need for social distancing and the government should release guidelines for the same. going forward, vending zones must also be designed keeping in mind the need for social distancing and for sufficient hygiene facilities (running water, washing stations and toilets). the authorities should work with town vending committees (tvcs) for the same.provide direct support which is de-linked from existing registration requirements: as lockdown is lifted and vending resumes, vendors who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to resume their work. the government stimulus package, while a welcome step, is insufficient in the nature of relief (credit not direct cash transfer) and eligibility (only registered vendors are eligible, which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country). in addition, government relief and support needs to be de-linked from very rigid registration requirements, as very few vendors have been registered in india. in delhi, out of roughly 300,000 street vendors, only about 131,00 have some form of occupational identification. if the criteria for any kind of cash grant or livelihood support is linked to occupational identification by the state, then the government should also accept registration with a workers organisation/union as a proxy for government-issued vending passes.ensuring hygiene and social distancing at sites of vending: the government needs to take steps for provision of running water and soap/sanitisers for street vendors at their place of work. additionally, vendor organisations should work with food safety authorities in the country to train vendors (especially cooked food vendors) in ways to maintain hygiene while working.taking steps to survey and register more vendors for access to government benefits: as mentioned earlier, the number of vendors who have some form of identification are a fraction of the actual population of vendors in delhi. before the crisis and subsequent lockdown, the town vending committees (tvcs) were supposed to start surveying and registering vendors. as we get used to the new normal, the process of survey and registration should also begin to ensure that all vendors are able to access social security benefits and financial aid during this period of crisis.","['vendor', 'fruit', 'vegetable',

2,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/impacts-of-covid-19-on-vegetable-vendors/,Impacts of COVID 19 on Vegetable Vendors - Blackcoffer Insights,"the covid-19 pandemic has grown into one of the most major and socially disruptive health crises in recent memory, with growing worried about how the pandemics catastrophic economic and social repercussions are affecting food systems at both the global and local levels. given the importance of the retail food environment in establishing and sustaining healthy diets, interruptions to specific aspects of it, such as the availability of fresh vegetables, could have a negative influence on population health, which has already been noted as a source of worry.despite the dominance of national and international supermarket chains, warehouse clubs, and supercenters in grocery retail, vegetables are offered in a number of other food retail settings. fresh vegetable are typically smaller and more community-oriented than other restaurant or retail food outlets and can include chain or independent grocery stores, greengrocers, storefront stands, street carts, and even makeshift platforms dedicated to the sale of fresh vegetables. smaller community fresh vegetable vendors who may conduct business on the sides of major streets or on storefronts have played an integral role in the food environment in large urban centers such as new york city (nyc), particularly in ethnic enclaves, despite the fact that fresh produce does not have a significantly higher nutritional value and fresh produce can also be purchased at these larger food retailers.since the covid-19 pandemic began, many fresh fruit and vegetable vendors, notably street carts selling fresh vegetables in cities across the united states, including new york city, have been forced to close owing to a combination of falling demand and fear of catching covid-19. the importance of fresh vegetable vendors varies by neighborhood within cities. furthermore, these fresh vegetable vendors attract visitors and interborough shoppers from a variety of cultural backgrounds not only asian ones who are looking for things that are not available elsewhere in the city or for the same low prices.these fresh vegetable vendors, unlike larger, well-established grocery store vendors, may not have the financial infrastructure to sustain the shifts in supply and demand produced by the covid-19 epidemic; consequently, the danger of closure or modifications in services may be greater for these vendors.in order to assess the impact of the covid-19 pandemic on services offered by fresh vegetable vendors, surveillance from both before and after the pandemics inception is required.after a few days, vegetable dealers began venturing out without explicit permission and were quickly harassed by police. after a few weeks, the government relaxed the limitations, allowing vital traders to sell their wares (due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks). however, the cost of doing business has increased dramatically, as vendors no longer have access to wholesale markets and suppliers, and they must spend more on travel expenditures owing to city-imposed travel limitations. furthermore, with the partial lockdown still in place, the number of buyers has decreased, as have earnings. perishable vegetables have a shorter shelf life in the summer heat, thus vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have.consider the situation of delhi at the starting of covid 19. the state has launched an inr 5000 crore stimulus package for over 50 lakh vendors, realizing the serious consequences of their loss of livelihood. the targeted relief for vendors is a credit facility that will provide all sellers with an initial working capital of inr 10,000, but this will not be enough. instead of credit, the government should consider changing it into a direct income benefit, such as a cash grant, to help people start earning money on a regular basis. the vendors require income support in order to resume work, and how will they repay the loan if they are unable to do so? vendor organizations must step forth in the face of the ever-changing crises and lobby for vendors to be given the resources they need to continue their livelihoods. vendor organizations could use the following as part of their advocacy agenda:promotion of vendors livelihoods, particularly those selling non-essential goods: covid-19 has had a particularly painful impact on informal labourers, who have spent all of their savings and wages trying to feed themselves during the prolonged lockdown. vendors must be permitted to restart peddling in order to survive, and the government should take steps to reopen marketplaces and reintroduce vendors to the streets.market reopening with social distance and hygiene in mind: delhi features a variety of typically crowded markets, including weekly markets (for fresh food, cooked meals, and necessary household items) and daily markets on the sides of highways. these markets will need to resume considering the necessity for social separation, and the government should issue recommendations in this regard. in the future, vending zones must be planned with social distancing in mind, as well as adequate sanitary facilities (running water, washing stations and toilets). for this, the government should collaborate with town vending committees (tvcs).provide direct assistance that is not tied to existing registration requirements: when the lockdown is lifted and vending starts, vendors who have been at home for months will require direct income benefits in order to return to work. while the government stimulus plan is a positive step, it falls short in terms of assistance (credit rather than direct cash transfer) and eligibility (only registered vendors are eligible, which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country). furthermore, government assistance and support must be divorced from the countrys strict registration requirements, as only a few vendors have been registered in india. only about 131,00 of delhis 300,000 street sellers have any type of employment identity. if the state requires occupational identity for any type of monetary grant or livelihood assistance, the government should accept registration with a workers organization/union as a surrogate for government-issued vending passes.providing flowing water and soap/sanitizers to street sellers at their place of business: the government should take steps to provide street vendors with running water and soap/sanitizers at their place of business. additionally, vendor organizations should collaborate with local food safety authorities to instruct vendors (particularly those selling prepared foods) on how to maintain hygiene while on the job.taking measures to conduct a survey and register additional vendors for government assistance: as previously stated, the number of sellers with some sort of identity is a small percentage of the total number of vendors in delhi. the town vending committees (tvcs) were expected to begin surveying and registering vendors before the crisis and ensuing lockout. as we adjust to the new normal, the survey and registration procedure should begin to guarantee that all vendors have access to social security benefits and financial assistance during this difficult time.finally, some fresh vegetable sellers may have shuttered for a period of time early in the epidemic, only to reopen recently. alternatively, vendors may have launched soon after the in-person checks were completed, but still within the june-july 2020 endpoint timeframe. this is a drawback of the method; in order to offer the most reliable covid-19 pandemic monitoring data, data must be collected in a short period of time.","['covid', 'pandemic', 'grown', 'one', 'major', 'socially', 'disruptive', 'health', 'crisis', 'recent', 'memory', 'growing',

3,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/impact-of-covid-19-pandemic-on-tourism-aviation-industries/,Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Tourism & Aviation industries - Blackcoffer Insights,"as the coronavirus pandemic unfolds, most industries face problems they had never imagined or prepared for. the aviation and tourism industries face the highest stress as coronavirus spreads because not only are they a (usually) a leisure spending but also the nature of the disease directly conflicts with the industries innate business models. in this article, we will look at the impact of covid-19 pandemic on the tourism and aviation industries both from the demand side and the supply side.the aviation and tourism industries has two major customers: tourists and business travellers. let us base this essay in the india and see what the reaction of the customer segments is expected to be like.almost all tourists will avoid vacationing for the foreseeable future because of:financial hardship: an exceptionally large part of the worlds working population has been affected financially because of the pandemic. unemployment rates are soaring and the ones who do still have a job are facing pay-cuts, furloughs and deferment of salaries.risk of contraction: because the disease spreads via social contact, it will only be safe to vacation if the destination is regularly sanitized and is not crowded. inherently, tourist destinations are not compliant with these regulations and even if the industry makes a change to being clean and introducing social distancing measures, convincing risk averse tourists of to travel to these vacation spots will be difficult.expansion of alternatives ways to relax: as most people adapt to work-from-home environments, the burnout rate is declining. people are more relaxed in their own homes and very few people are eagerly looking for a getaway. combined with this deterrent is the rise of alternative ways to relax. more and more people are going out for walks, doing yoga and finding new hobbies. due to this increase for pursuit for happiness at home, it might be likely that tourists will avoid traveling because they dont feel the urge to break-free and move away for a holiday.now, let us look at different types of holiday revellers. tourists can be foreigners or domestic tourists. according to business insider in2019, almost 10 million foreigntouristsvisitedindia spending over 1,800 billion during january to november period.. however, because of the pandemic, almost all this business has been lost.due to the reasons stated above most foreigners will not prefer to travel. those who do dare to venture out, perhaps wooed by discounted deals to places which would have otherwise been out of their budgets, will possibly be warded off by the one of the following factors:poor quality of health care in india: in the off chance that a tourist contracts covid-19, they will probably be accustomed to a better healthcare system than the one india provides. being a developing country india will find it hard to convince foreign tourists that our healthcare systems are up to the mark of their home countries.densely populated regions around tourist destinations: because most tourist destinations support a neighbouring economy, the areas are often densely populated, which leads to a higher risk of transmission of covid-19 and the foreign tourists are cognizant of this fact.moving our focus to domestic tourists, we subdivide our population according to income levels:below poverty line: these people dont travellower income families: these people majorly only travel to religious places or to visit family. thus, they dont contribute to the aviation industry at all and generate very little revenue for the tourism industry as they prefer to stay in cheap lodges or at a relatives place.middle income families: they travel once in a year or two and tend to avoid airplanes. revenue in the tourism industry is also limited from this subsection.upper middle income families: they vacation regularly, often flying to near-by holiday spots. this section of our economy is severely hit by the coronavirus financial hardships. people have lost jobs and almost everyone has low liquidity. being risk averse, these people will probably save money and avoid spending on vacations for some time. the loss of volumes from this sector will affect the aviation and tourism industries severely.high income families: this sector is relatively insulated from the financial hardships caused by coronavirus and is likely to spend on holidays if they are assured of the sanitization and social distancing.in order to attract well paying customers, the aviation and tourism industries will have to spend a considerable amount of money to become sanitation compliant which will push profit margins even lower. most aviation and tourism activities made money not on individual margins but on collective volumes, thus, they are inherently incompatible with the concept of social distancing.because of covid-19 pandemic, businesses have realized that more and more meetings can be handled over video calls, thus, the movement of business personnel will be restricted. there will still be some representatives who will fly out to conduct business, but the industry can expect a permanent drop in revenue from this sector.moving over to the supply side, the aviation and tourism industries face strong disruptions in their supply chain. because the industry is a leisure expense, manufacturing of many supporting equipment like the adventure sports gears and even parts of planes themselves has stopped. because of the drop in demand, it is going to be tough to get the supply chain back up again. furthermore, workers are afraid to show up to their jobs because of the high risk of contracting the virus due to exposure to multiple customers from different geographies.let us now see some examples of how the industry has done through march and april.airbnbs (in america): the bookings vanished in mid-march. property owners had bought or leased real estate to list on the app were severely affected. the sharing economy, like uber, lyft and doordash had taken a hit but airbnb was worse off because their expenses include cleaning services, interior design (one-time spend), and property maintenance which are fixed costs.thus, because of the pandemic the revenue was gone but the costs exist. they have people who depend on the owners rental income which made the problem worse.hosts usually decide cancellation policy, but under extreme circumstances, like this one, the company decided to override all existing policies (many of whom werent strict) and gave full refund to the guests. the company got $2 billion loan and has helped out the owners, financially by paying 25% for cancelled bookings capping at 5k/host. they have helped some hosts by getting them eligible for small business loans and avoid eviction.thankfully, there are too few properties to cause a housing crisis, but breakdown could cause strain on lenders and undermine property values (all want to sell to avoid foreclosure or defaulting on loans). airdna states that the listing split-up for airbnb is: 33% list single property, 33% owners list 2-24 properties, 33% hosts have 25+ properties.some state governments in america have banned short-term rentals. this hurt the airbnb owners because people looking to quarantine outside their homes or near relatives couldve generated revenues.so, what are hosts doing now?many are discounting units and looking for long-term tenants (12 months). many are planning to apply for a small-business loan, seek forbearance from banks, find long-term tenants independently of airbnb and sell property.reluctance of workers to comeback to work (america):according to the wall street journal, roughly half of all us workers stand to earn more from the coronavirus rather than their work pay cheques. however, it must be noted that some have not gotten their money due to bureaucratical issues.this complicates reopening because workers dont want to come back and expose themselves to the virus and earn less. but businesses want workers to come back so that their small business loans can be forgiven, and business can reopen. however, money in the consumers pockets means the economy expected to rebound quickly when businesses open. about 40 million americans are now on unemployment benefits, majorly from restaurant, hospitality, and retail industries.congress chose a flat amount of relief because it was really time-consuming for payments to be calibrated to each workers lost wages. their $600 federal payment corresponds to $15/hours wage, but 21 states follow $7.25/hours.most workers dont want to sit at home and are anxious to get back to work, but right now staying at home is the smartest financial decision for their families.workers should be ineligible for unemployment benefits if a job is made available to them. but owners are reluctant to report workers to authorities and sever relationships with employees they may need more later in the year when tourism demand is expected to pick up. without income support, low-wage workers would likely seek out other jobs, including side hustles and gig work, which could expose them and their households to the virus. thus, according to the government, it was important to give such a large stimulus to the economy.coronavirus on planes:studies of sars suggested that people sitting close to infectious persons were at large risk. combined with that, in long journeys, passengers may take off masks.thus, the risks of transmission are large and airlines need to focus on figuring out how to prevent transmission in planes.currently, the airlines plan on using self-cleaning material, long-lasting disinfectant, touchless lavatories, uv light as a disinfectant, antimicrobial coating for frequently touched surfaces, and cleaning between flights.however, even after these efforts, only 12% of people are flying (compared to last year, same time) as of 27th may 2020.aviation and tourism industries have the curse of being a luxury expense and thus, as the coronavirus pandemic spread, the entire industry jolted to a halt. they are one of the hardest-hit sectors and have to adapt to a new normal wherein the revenue levels are unlikely to match to pre-covid levels and margins have also reduced. however, in with a bleak future, this industry is here to stay because people have to travel, and eventually they will vacation as well. coronavirus has become a survival of the fittest test for this industry and the stakeholders will come out of this disaster with strong business processes.","['coronavirus',

exorbitantly increased their scale of operations and have overall reaped hefty profits. so what is it that differentiates these areas from the rest and what can we learn from them?a path to victoryif we look at the evolving it/ites industry around the world, the domains that have flourished in this strenuous time all have had one key characteristic in common; flexibility. these sectors have adopted a more flexible approach to dealing with the lockdown. be it flexible working procedures or adopting newer, more advanced ways of working in line with the requirements of our time, they havent shied away from changing the rules of the game. lets look at some of these areas within the tech domain that have been successful in conquering the lockdown.social medialockdowns around the globe have confined people inside their homes, with nothing much to do of significance. as a result, social networking sites have reported a gigantic rise in user engagement over the lockdown period. reportedly, there has been close to a 50% rise in daily text transmissions across messaging platforms such as facebook, instagram, and whatsapp in the hardest-hit economies. twitter has reported a 23% increase in its user base as compared to last year. the data makes it evident that social media platforms are here to reap the benefits of a lockdown situation.video consumption sites such as youtube, instagram, and tiktok are in line to reap massive profits. its no wonder that viewership on these platforms has increased manifolds due to lockdowns. these platforms serve to be a distraction from the tragedies of the real world in such stressing times and offer an easy escape. be it rumors regarding the cure for covid 19, gossips, or rap battles; these platforms provide viewers with their much-needed dose of distractions. as they say, ignorance is bliss.data-mining enterprisesthe lockdown has proven to be a miracle for data-mining companies. with such an exorbitant increase in the number of hours spent online globally, these firms now have access to significantly larger sets of data than they otherwise could ever have. widespread implementation of data-mining has been seen recently with most countries opting for government-regulated surveillance applications that monitor your movement at all times. moreover, these applications have access to your personal information as well as medical records. countries such as south korea and singapore are at the helm of relying on such means to control the outbreak.although noble, such initiatives do raise a red flag with regards to user privacy. the public has been provided with very little information about how these applications operate and what goes on behind the scenes. this creates an atmosphere of obscurity that is frankly harmful to the premise of a democracy.cloud computingcloud computing has been on the rise for the last couple of years. however, the pandemic has made it the de facto king in terms of computational services. with an increasing reliance on remote working, the ability to store data in one secure location has turned out to be critical.the cloud computing services such as amazon web services, microsoft azure, and google cloud have reaped hefty profits in the process. the emerging landscape in the tech world seems to suggest an upward trend in reliability on these services as far as large scale data storage and computing is concerned.e-commercesocial distancing measures have made it practically impossible for people to physically go shopping for groceries and other necessities. moreover, a majority of retail outlets in cities have reported negligible engagement, for the fear of transmission of the virus. e-commerce sites have been the real winners in this predicament of global consumerism.with high standards of hygiene and at-home delivery, these sites have provided an easy alternative to retail stores. other similar businesses include food delivery apps and grocery sites that are also flourishing today amidst the pandemic. recent weeks have made it evident that e-commerce websites are well on their way to abolish traditional shopping methods.ott platformsonline streaming platforms consist of a relatively newer approach to entertainment; having only been in existence for the past couple of years. they had already, however, established a name for themselves before the lockdowns. sites such as netflix and amazon prime had been dominating a chunk of the market share and competing heavily with movie theatres for new releases, for a while now. now with the lockdown practically deleting theatres and cable tv from the collective psyche of the entertainment industry, they are well on their way to becoming the platform of choice as far as entertainment for the masses is concerned.this has already become evident, with zee5 india reporting a whopping 80% increase in subscriptions and a 50% increase in the time spent on their site, within the first couple of weeks of the lockdown itself. another such platform mubi reported a 28% rise in its viewership in india only a week after lockdown commenced. these facts are a clear indication of the exponential growth that is in store for these platforms, which is unlikely to change anytime soon.video-conferencing platformsthe idea of working from home is all set to be the new norm in our professional culture, which requires an easy and effective way to communicate over the internet. not just audio or text, but video conferencing is the need today. hence its understandable why multiple video conferencing services are set to reap massive profits off of the new norm.arguably the most popular of these, zoom has reported a 130% increase in its price share since the beginning of 2020. another such platform known as the microsoft teams collaboration suite, operated by microsoft, has reported a whopping 12 million increase in its user base in the very first week of the lockdown in the us. this data is only likely to have an upwards trajectory considering the increasing pace at which industries are going online.the indian picturethe indian it landscape has also undergone massive cultural changes. according to rajesh gopinathan, chief executive officer and managing director of tata consultancy services ltd., the work from home model of operations is here to stay. he also claimed that the firms only requires a 25% workforce to be physically present for any project at any of the locations.tata consultancy services which is one of the major players in the indian it landscape has shifted almost 90% of its workforce into a remote borderless workspace model, and other smaller firms have followed suit. what it tells us is that were headed in a direction were unlikely to return from. remote working appears to be the modern protocol for operations and is unlikely to change anytime soon.however, a major challenge often overlooked in such circumstances is that of an adaptable culture. the culture of workspaces has to be drastically altered and members of the workforce have to dive headfirst into the new way of doing business. this is critical to ensure that the industry can combat the pandemic and recover gloriously.a duality unlike any otherthe lockdown has presented us with a stark contrast unlike any other weve witnessed. where on the one hand, the industries mentioned above seem to be exhibiting exponential growth with their people thriving and having every possible resource at their disposal, the unorganized sector and the msmes (micro, small and medium enterprises) seem to be at the crux of death.the sector that consists of people for whom having guidelines to work from home is irrelevant as that was never really an option; people with no fixed wages or social security to fall back on during this time of crisis. as a result of the lockdown, several of these msmes have effectively become inoperable and have resorted to massive layoffs just to survive. this has resulted in thousands of workers losing their jobs with nowhere to go to for refuge. a chunk of these people includes migrant workers who have lost their jobs and are left with little to no avenue to feed themselves. not receiving significant support from the government, these people have been initiating treks back to their villages. what is witnessed is a massive influx of migrant workers flooding the highways, walking weeks to find shelter and food. truck drivers responsible for delivering goods have also resigned stating that they have no means to eat because of the closure of every food joint on the highways. both these realities present a stark contrast and expose a deep crack in our societal framework. one i reckon wont heal anytime soon.a train unlikely to haltthe covid 19 pandemic has restructured our social fabric in a way that is unlikely to change anytime soon. the areas that weve discussed are likely to become the flagbearers of the digital revolution of the decade. an upward mobilization with regards to massive scale movement of industries online seems pertinent today being led by these domains in the it industry. an unfortunate consequence of it is that a majority of the msmes may soon cease to exist, having been replaced by some of the other alternatives that weve discussed. it seems to be a never-ending circle where the ones who are making a profit out of this situation will continue to do so, while the others will be washed out from our collective memory.","['covid', 'pandemic', 'reshaped', 'fundamental', 'fabric', 'world', 'initiating', 'china', 'late',

6,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/online-gaming-adolescent-online-gaming-effects-demotivated-depression-musculoskeletal-and-psychosomatic-symptoms/,Online gaming: Adolescent online gaming effects us | how,"introductiona video game is any software program that can be played on a computing device, such as a personal computer, gaming console, or mobile device. video games have been in existence since the early 1970s and have become increasingly popular, spanning different mobile (smartphones, tablets) and stationary (computer or console) platforms. advances, particularly in mobile devices, have given birth to social networks and group gamingalthough the nature of gaming does not require physical stamina and therefore is not limited by factors such as age, gender, or fitness, it is most popular with adolescents. in 2018, the world health organization (who) classified gaming disorder in their international classification of diseases (icd-11). the icd-11 is a list of diseases and medical conditions that aids health professionals in making diagnoses and treatment plans for patients having various disorders. it should be noted that, the inclusion of gaming disorder in the icd-11 by who has generated vigorous and sometimes contentious debate and discussion within the medical and mental health community. although recognized as an area of clinical interest, the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm-5) published by the american psychiatric association suggests that more clinical research is required before gaming disorder is formally considered as a psychiatric disorder. similarly, the who notes the inclusion of gaming disorder in icd-11, to encourage more research into excessive gaming behavior, including its prevention and treatment.what is online gaming disorder?2018 who draft 11th revision of the icd-11 denotes the disorder as a pattern of digital-gaming or video-gaming behavior characterized by impaired control over gaming activity, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and the continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.online gaming disorder has the same similarities with internet gaming disorder (igd), which is a condition that the american psychiatric association (apa) noted in dsm-5 as an area in need of additional study. the apa does not currently recognize igd as an official condition. for gaming disorder to be diagnosed, the who criteria require that the behavioral pattern of the gamer must be of sufficient severity that major and noticeable impairment and deterioration in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning is present for a minimum of 12 months.signs and symptoms of online gaming disorderaccording to the who definition, a person with online gaming disorder will demonstrate the following characteristics for at least 12 months; problems controlling control their gaming habits, seeing gaming as more important over other necessities and daily activities or work, continuing to engage in gaming even after its negative health and social problems has been identified or are evident. further research shows that gaming disorders can also be linked to anxiety, depression, obesity, sleeping disorders, and stress. people who remain physically inactive for long periods because of gaming may also be at higher risk of obesity, sleep disorders, and other health-related issues, according to who [1].health consequences of video online gamingvideo game-related health problems can cause continuous strain injuries, skin disorders, and other health issues. other problems according to shoja et al. (2007), include a condition that could be termed video game-provoked seizures in patients with pre-existing epilepsy. the following health consequences of video gaming have been reported.vision issuesvideo game playing is associated with eye problems. extensive and fixed staring at a video game screen causes eyestrain because the cornea, pupil, and iris are not biologically equipped for chronic heavy viewing of digital images from electronic devices. the visual system strain from frequent video game use over extended periods may result in headaches, dizziness, and in some cases, nausea and vomiting. interestingly, there is some research that shows that gamers have an enhancement of spatial distribution of attention, compared with non-gamers. this somewhat predictable practice effect occurs with both peripheral and central visual attention. for sufferers of amblyopia (dimness or blurring of the eyesight due to a fault in transmission from the eye to the brain) video games may be helpful.musculoskeletal problemspersistent gamers may also suffer from musculoskeletal problems. a survey of children indicated increased physical complaints associated with video game playing. such complaints range from pain in the hands and wrists to back and neck. furthermore, a case report involving a nine-year-old teenager referenced playstation thumb. playstation thumb is, characterized by numbness and a blister is caused by friction between the thumb and the controller from rapid and persistent gameplay. using dermoscopy, dermatologists discovered hemorrhages and onycholysis (the loosening or separation of a fingernail) in a patient who presented with hyperkeratosis. also, tendon injuries (tendinosis) of the hands and wrists from tendon overuse, is another health problem associated with video game playing. furthermore, another case report in the new england journal of medicine reported a fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal from people who play wii video games. this condition has been termed (perhaps sarcastically), a wii fracture. there are also postural problems associated with the persistent playing of video games, although, ergonomic measures (including chair to monitor position) could potentially improve postural problems associated with video game playing.obesity and overweightplaying video games consistently has been associated with obesity. this is maybe related to the lack of physical activity in players. alternatively, it could be that those who are less physically fit because of obesity gravitate towards less physically demanding activities, such as gaming. in either case, several studies have linked television and video games and increased body mass index (bmi). it has been estimated that children in the united states spend 25% of their waking hours watching either television or playing video games. furthermore, children who watch the most hours of television or play video games have the highest incidence of obesity. if video games are replacing physical activities and young people do not participate in physical recreation or see playing of video games as a form of recreation, this may be part of the link between times spent while playing video games and a rise in bmi in teenagers. evidence for this potential link gains some support from a german study reporting that boys who spend no more than 1.5 hours per day engaged in television watching or playing video games, were 75.4% less likely to be overweight than those who spend more than 1.5 hours engaged in the same activity.in a 2011 study, an association between video game activity and an increase of (mostly junk) food intake was reported. specifically, single video game sessions caused an increase in food intake, regardless of appetite. it has also been suggested that active video game play using two popular gaming platforms has the opposite effect. other researchers found no evidence that more active video games would result in a beneficial outcome although the study did demonstrate an increase in the amount of physical activity within the children receiving the active video games.seizures (epileptic)health concerns that video games may cause epileptic seizures started in the early 1980s. the first medically documented case of a video game-induced seizure was reported in 1981. in 1993, a story in the popular press (sun newspaper) reported that a boy choked to death on his own vomit during a seizure triggered by playing a video game. similar but less serious incidents were subsequently reported by news media around the world, ultimately motivating video game console manufacturers to include that epilepsy warnings in the instruction manuals for their gaming products. in 1994 it was reported that video games only cause seizures in people already predisposed to epilepsy and advised that people with a predisposition to epilepsy can greatly reduce the risk of a seizure by staying 10 feet or more away from the tv set and wearing sunglasses while playing video games. this is clearly an area in need of additional research.prevention and treatment of online gaming disorderthe cost: benefit value of prevention versus treatment of addiction disorders has been known for many years. it is important and beneficial to make use of several types of strategies in combating gaming addictiveness or disorder. effective strategies include: educating gamers about gaming behaviors and consequences on their mental health; treatment geared towards helping the gamer to control his/her urge for video games, recognizing and dealing with disturbing thoughts and learning how to cope without video games; intrapersonal and interpersonal counseling to help gamers to explore their identity, build self-esteem, and enhance their emotional intelligence outside the fictional world of gaming and learning communication and assertiveness skills needed in social interactions; family involvement, including counseling and discussion family and other relationships; and developing new lifestyles. the latter is particularly important and to paraphrase the well-known mantra of alcoholics anonymous, its all about, people, places, and things. to prevent the persistent playing of video games, people need to explore new activities, set new goals and metrics of achievements beyond video game scores.","['introductiona', 'video', 'game', 'software', 'program', 'played', 'computing', 'device', 'personal', 'computer', 'gaming', 'console', 'mobile', 'device', 'video', 'game', 'existence',

8,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-voice-search-makes-your-business-a-successful-business/,How Voice search makes your business a successful business. - Blackcoffer Insights,"finding ways to make using the internet easier is something most modern consumers are passionate about. since the rise of ai-infused technology like amazons alexa or apples siri, voice search has grown increasingly popular. in fact, nearly60 percent of people all over the worlduse voice search at least once a day.as this technology grows more popular and complex with each passing day, business owners are starting to take notice of voice search. capitalizing on this trend is only possible when optimizing the content on your website for voice search. are you trying to make your website more voice search-friendly? if so, check out the following tips.1. accuracy of voice searchin the past, if you wanted relevant answers from a voice recognition technology, wellgood luck with that. but today, machine learning systems can compete with people in terms of accuracy. googles voice recognition, google is now able to understand human language with 95 percent accuracy. these improvements mean that, while you can trust good voice systems to match customers with the right products, services, or information with increasing degrees of nuance, leading businesses already have set customer expectations for delivery. thanks to machine learning algorithms that can detect speech and respond with meaningful results.2. the interest in voice is only going to growbecause voice search systems are at a point where they actually can perform reliably and meet customer expectations just as well (if not better) than traditional query options, customer trust in them is growing:60% of 18-to-49-year-oldstalk to automated voice systems at least once a day.voice shoppingis expected to reach $40 billion by 2022up from $2 billion in 2018;global smart speaker salesexpected to exceed $30 billion by 2024.30% of peoplewho dont have a voice assistant would like to buy one.50% of smart speaker ownerswould like to get information about deals, sales, and promotions.yet, only4% of businessesare properly optimized for voice search. whats with the disconnect? in other words, business leaders are at an ideal intersection where reliable systems are available and there are still many customers who havent been reached or who might want more out of the systems they currently use. bringing those systems and customers together will help companies avoid being left behind.3. people are after convenience and all types of informationwhen people use voice search, they dont just want to locate a great pair of shoes or a tv.people want all kinds of other information, such as your store hours, how to connect to support specialists, and when youre having your next sale. this is partly why some experts have predicted a totally different internet within the next five to 10 years, one where voice-activated chatbots have all but replaced the e-commerce channels were used to using. shoppers are also after general tips that can take some of the friction out of everyday lifethink life hacks and how-tos. in fact, words like how, what, best, and easy are among the top voice search queries. this means that when it comes to online marketing, you probably need to change your entire optimization approach, taking elements like grammar and semantics, the structure of your site, and structured data markup that influences googles ability to find your content. of course, optimizing from the start, not as an afterthought, is ideal.4. how voice become part of customer-brand interactions voice search can be used on both desktop and mobile searches. we can see that customers want different types of information from voice systems, they also can use it at many points in the customer journey. for example, about half of shoppers use voice to research products, even near me searches results are mostly done by customers.customers also use voice to:add items to shopping lists (36%)track packages (30%)make a purchase (22%)give a rating or review (20%)contact support (18%)reorder something (17%)these statistics show you should think beyond just having customers find you or your products. voice search and commands can take your buyers from start to finish, so give your customers as much convenience and satisfaction as possible by integrating voice options into more types of interactions.5. voice is often just the starting point","['finding', 'way', 'make',

9,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-the-covid-19-crisis-is-redefining-jobs-and-services/,How the COVID-19 crisis is redefining jobs and services? - Blackcoffer Insights,"the pandemic has shaken the world in the way one had hardly imagined. the impact of it on jobs and services is going to be long-lasting and it will be the foundation stone of revolution in these sectors. with the work from home and social distancing norms is altering the way of work, the way we interact, what work we will do, how the work will be done, and whatnot. to just give an example, in the middle of the first lockdown, fmcg major hindustan unilever (hul) went ahead with its merger. it took place online entirely. yes, it took place online. who could have ever imagined the merger can take place online?change is inevitable. but some changes are temporary and some are permanent. the pandemic is bringing changes that are going to be permanent. in fact, these changes were due for a long time and were coming at a slow pace. what the pandemic has done is, it has become the catalyst for these changes and raised the ante for change. so, what exactly the changes will be? lets look at them one by one.the first change is going to be the extensive use of digital communication from now onwards. the zoom, jio meet, google meet, and some derivatives like these are going to be the forever meeting rooms where the important discussions will be held. this may be bad news for the employees who are older than 40 years. they would not have pictured themselves doing such transformation at this part of life. experts believe that the new normal in the offices are going to be hierarchy-less. the older employees would have to work with the younger ones. there would be no geographical boundaries and where the communication and software adaptability among employees is going to be crucial. the symbol of power will be less visible and the decentralization of power in the office will be prominent. there will be more egalitarianism in companies. the corporates will think much more about office space. rather than expending too much on physical infrastructure, the online infrastructure will always be in their hindsight. the impact would be more prudent in small and mid-sized businesses. the physical offices itself might disappear from such businesses. but its not going to be easy for companies. the security and confidentiality of the authentic information going out of the offices building are going to be the largest concern in the new normal world. there would be no surprise if a lot of start-ups will bloom in the near future providing software for security for the data and information of the companies. also, travel is going to be reduced. so, the major component of ctc where the companies fooling the employees must find the other way.the second change is going to be struck down on employees. already many of the companies and start-ups are reducing the workforce. it is expected that new normal offices would work with an 80% workforce of that of the current workforce. automation is on the verge. due to safety reasons, the companies are going to be more and more leaned towards automation with a minimal touch of human possible. this might result in a loss of jobs in some sectors, but it will also create new jobs in the automation sector. it was evident from before pandemic too but now the velocity for the same would be increased. in the new normal tech-enabled world, the job which would be at stake dominantly would be managers managers. the it firms have started firing the vice presidents and assistant vice presidents who draw hefty salaries but dont really drive the business. in the designation-less set up in the near future accelerated by pandemic, they automatically become redundant. for the first time, the employees might be given jobs that would require more than the standard jobs. also, when the workforce in the company would be less in the company, the employees might be given the option of working for extra time or working on the weekends and would be incentivized for the same rather than employing more staff and paying them full salary. it is a win-win situation for both employees and companies. employees can earn more than what they usually earn and will get to learn new which would be out of their primary domain. the companies would be able to keep their costs low through this. the assessment of employees might change too. rather than going for an annual performance review, the employees might be evaluated based on the tasks they perform. creativity and innovation are going to be swords for the employees in the new normal world rather than designations in the office. the other change might be in the services sector. the services like which involves maximum human touch will be the one which will be affected most adversely. the safety concerns and confidence of people over the system are going to be the issue for at least the next few years. it also opens the opportunity for something very new. the products which could replace the need for visiting such services centers are going to create a boom in the market. according to mckinsey, the sales for such products are multiplying rapidly.there are speculations that the economies will tend to become minimalist economies. lets dig deep into this. minimalist economies are the economies where people tend to refrain from purchasing luxurious items and focuses on purchasing necessities more and more. well, this is the position we are in right now during the pandemic. people are expensing only necessary items like groceries and the demand for luxurious items is way below average. but it would be hard to stay the same as this. the minimalist economy will result in the deterioration of the economy in the short term. it is true that in the minimalist economy the demand might be low, but it would be wrong to assume the demand will be zero. the high-quality products will gather the attention of the purchasers. it is evident from past experiences that the economy always finds its way to come back from the mode of minimalist economy. though this time may take some time, it will surely return on track.but every trouble comes with an opportunity. this is the time for the companies to act now and grab the opportunities the pandemic has brought with him. but for that companies are required to follow plans, formulate strategies to suit their needs, and pay more attention to the innovation. the companies must form plans for the five stages from here. these stages are 5rs: resolve, resilience, return, reimagination, and reform.resolve: in the resolve phase companies need to formulate a nerve center to combat corvid itself. the tendency of the company should not be like that, they will return only after everything becomes normal. in most parts of the country, permission is granted to the companies for their operations. if they wait for normalcy, then bankruptcy might catch them before the normalcy.resilience: the resilience phase includes maintaining liquidity, addressing solvency, and grow for sustainability. all businesses should know when their cash crunch is coming. addressing these cash crunches will be crucial for the companies. businesses must take aggressive options to remain solvent. for example, the businesses might have cash in their hand but might be poor in operational efficiency then it requires the attention of the company. organizations solving issues of liquidity and solvency will be in a better position to grow with sustainability.return: in the third phase of return the companies will have to plan for the time when everything will be back on track. given the possibility of subsequent waves of coronavirus the companies need new ways of working to prevent, identify, report, and contain future flareups. many industries will face this problem of returning. staying prepared for resurgence scenarios should include a multi-scenario modeling exercise. reverting to non-covid-19 care will require extensive planning and market testing.reimagine: the phase of reimagining will include the learnings from the pandemic. a small virus and the whole economy at the toss. the businesses will have to introspect them and must look for advancements in technologies such that this kind of pandemic in the future will not disturb their efficiency too much. the pandemic has taught us that the decision which took weeks and months in the normal world can be accelerated and can be taken in some days. this should become a permanent feature. cross organizational collaboration has become much easier. this should stay in the long run.reform: the last phase is the reform. in this phase, the companies should look at their bottlenecks and try to fix them. also, the companies will have to reconsider their relationship with their customers. the confidence in their brands, they must regain it.there are three ways to shift work, talent, and skills to where and when they are needed most, thereby building the organizational resilience and agility necessary to navigate uncertain times and rebound with strength when the economy recovers.make work portable:in this dismal situation it is more important than ever most of the staff should be in the critical tasks. the tasks could be like the customer complaints redressal. we know that the customers are the ones who make the businesses successful. thus, retaining their confidence is the utmost priority. the organizations can convert some of the staff to address the queries and concerns of customers. the organizations require to create virtual offices. there should not be the geographical boundaries within the organization. the employees from all over the world from the organization should come together and take the organization back to pre-corvid state. by breaking out of rigid job constraints, the right talent and work can be matched to solve evolving business challenges in real-time.accelerate automation:this was happening before the pandemic too. but accelerating it with pace has now become the need of the hour. the perception that automation is a job-killer is totally wrong and in fact, it is the mandatory capability to deal with the crisis. organizations can increase automation in call centers. this will reduce the response time.share employees in cross-industry exchanges:temporarily moving employees from some industries like airlines, restaurants, hospitality can be moved to those organizations which have maximum work at this time like healthcare and logistics.to conclude, the companies should understand lives come first, but livelihood matters. the pandemic will have some adverse effects on jobs and services, but this is not the end. the pandemic has brought many opportunities with him and if they are grabbed then the organizations would be in much better position even compared to pre-corvid situations. the companies need to understand the pandemic is not going to be forever. the last concluding sentence will be corona will bring changes but there will not be a revolution in jobs and services.","['pandemic', 'shaken', 'world', 'way', 'one', 'hardly', 'imagined', 'impact', 'job', 'service', 'going', 'long', 'lasting', 'foundation', 'stone', 'revolution',

10,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-to-increase-social-media-engagement-for-marketers/,How to increase social media engagement for marketers? - Blackcoffer Insights,"social media is such a staple of our evolving digital culture that its almost hard to imagine a time without updates, likes, comments, and shares. people are more concerned about how their food looks than about how it tastes. thus, it has become necessary for any brand to have a social media presence. the phrase out of sight, out of mind has never been so apt than in todays time. social media is as much about engagement with other people as it is about sharing content. its why we call it social media.social media engagement simply is the interaction between the customer and the brand on social media platforms. where else are you going to find a huge database of your target demographic who are already in the mind frame to read, click on, and share your message?in practicality it is not about a one-off communication but more about the construction of a long-term relationship with your target customers. hence, when we talk about such a relationship it is imperative to consider the positive actions of users as a reaction of any brands engagement tactics.a fundamental customer journey can be envisaged in the form of customer funnel. the touchpoints available at every step can be shown as:awarenessconsiderationdecisionpurchasepost-purchasetouchpointsword of mouth, social media, regular advertisements on the customer journey mapcongruence with perceived and offered benefits, cost-benefit analysis, value propositionplace and time utility, loyalty towards product, switching costsretail/on-portal conversion levers, customer schemesdissonance, purchase complexityto understand the reach of social media by the use of numbersmost popular social networks worldwide as of july 2020, ranked by number of active users (in millions)how many retweets on twitter? how many reactions to the post on facebook? how many likes on instagram? how many shares on linked in? this seems to be the new age resume.thus, a good question or mystery for any brand is how to measure their social media engagement. as with most online actions, its often difficult to measure offline benefits. more often than not the online campaigns do not drive any conversions on the same day/week, but a user may see those posts and become more familiar with the brand. that familiarity, later on, might result in him choosing that brand over an unknown competitor. social media engagement as a result helps businesses in developing their brands personality, improves visibility, and becomes its voice.customers exhibit dynamic behavior based on the type of product. it could range from picking and variety-seeking to high involvement processes comprising extensive information search. top of the mind recall rules due to this purchasing behavior implies that targeted advertising and marketing is extremely important. no one engagement strategy can be applied across brands. each brands strategy must differ based on what the brand is trying to sell, its target customers, and the beliefs of the brand.some of the key aspects of marketing strategy that we have influenced as vital cogs in the digital marketing wheel are:influencer marketinginfluencer marketing involves a brand collaborating with an online influencer to market one of its products or services. here the audience doesnt care much about your brand but the opinions of the influencers.an influencer as being someone who has:the power to affect the purchasing decisions of others because of their knowledge, position, authority, or relationship with their audience.a following in a distinct niche, with whom they regularly engage. the size of the following depends on the size of their topic of the niche.2017 saw chanel being named as the most influential luxury brand on social media. since then, it has continued to grow and diversify its portfolio, while providing constant engagement to its plethora of followers, especially on instagram.cross-channel marketingcross-channel marketing or multi-channel marketing is the practice of using multiple channels to reach an audience. because not everyone uses every single platform, its a good idea to have a presence on a few, and share some of the same content across the different networks. what makes a difference in this marketing strategy is the choice of platforms. apart from using basics like facebook, instagram, and twitter a clever use of spotify, youtube, or igtv to showcase the brand can make a real difference.the luxury vehicle brand, land rovers cross-channel marketing includes the google display network, homepage masthead and masthead in lightbox ads on youtube, and visibility through mobile, search, and google+. the brands digital campaign included four different influencers who created visual content for their blogs by taking trips to places like glacier national park and the appalachian mountains and land rovers microsite. their cross-channel efforts resulted in 100 million impressions from youtube, and a 10% increase in search ad ctr. further results found that online leads from its digital channel efforts now account for 15% of the brands total sales.informativethe content created on social media must add some value addition to the customers. the brand must constantly keep informing the customers about their existing products, new products, achievements of the brands, or even casual content. there should be wow, i didnt know this factor. only then will they become regular followers of the brand.an example of this would be a cosmetic brand posting make-up tutorials. fenty beauty is one such prime example, which has built up to 1.4m followers within just 4 days of its launch, eventually garnering close to 10m followers, with rihanna being one of their icons.involving customers & engaging them:customer is king is a known concept. it is the foundation of traditional marketing. so while we shift to social platforms brands must not forget them. understanding their needs, addressing them, inviting them to respond and take part in the brands online activities while keeping it interesting and entertaining for the customer is the key.founder and ceo of glossier, emily weiss, described the brand as, the first socially-driven beauty brand. glossier was certainly the pioneer in the term instagram brands using the platform not only to build awareness but also to have focused conversation with the customer. glossier often crowdsources product development, asking its instagram followers what theyd like to see next.dynamicthe content creation must be dynamic and suitable for the current season, festival, or event that is happening. people must be able to relate to the posts and they must get excited after seeing it.starbucks does a marvelous job when it comes to being dynamic. their one-off recipes and continuous hype around seasonal events and related drinks have won them a silver ipa effectiveness award for its social strategy in 2018. the launch of its now iconic unicorn frappuccino, spurred on the trend of brands deliberately creating instagrammable food and drink. asa result, there are now 557,232 posts using the hashtag focussednow of course the real motive behind any marketing activity is to eventually sell the product. so it becomes extremely important to not lose the essence of the product while marketing. in simple terms, the content or strategy must not leave the customer confused about what the brand actually does or what it is trying to sell.to support the product-centric statement, oreo is the best example. oreos social media strategy has never diverged from its original formula. completely product-focused and yet always creative, the brand continuously finds ways to put its cookies center stage. the daily twist campaign to mark its 100th birthday, saw the brand turn its oreo cookie into something of cultural relevance for 100 days, including elvis presley, a baseball, and a rainbow flag in support of pride.visualsa picture is worth 1,000 words. this adage has never been more apt than in the age of social media. this is why visuals are so important in any marketing strategy. you can talk about a product all day, but until youre able to put it in front of someones eyes, its not going to have nearly the same effect. visual content marketing is a great way to make this happen and can be broken down into six basic types- comics, memes, infographics, photos, videos and visual note-taking.coca-cola has been a leader and trendsetter in the visual content marketing space for years. the 2020 initiative video paved the way for multiway communication, as opposed to the single way process that was prevalent.product demonstration:the barrier for electronic platforms has always been the loss of touch. customers often complain that till they dont touch, try or test the product they are not convinced if they want to purchase it. this can also be true for products that are new and the customers need to be educated about its use. hence it becomes important for brands to bridge this gap as far as possible through their online medium.product demonstrations are considered one of the most promising and upcoming applications of ar technology, giving brands a way to provide an immersive experience to consumers. gucci partnered with snapchat for the first global branded ar shoe try on the lens, hugely increasing fanfare!social messagecorporate social responsibility should not be missed when it comes to social media engagement. if a brand has the reach to spread awareness then they must use it. creating content to spread social awareness adds an emotional touch too. if a customer connects with a brand on an emotional level its hard for competitors to break it.doves steady and impactful social message still stands out as marketing thats more than just marketing. the real beauty campaign has been refreshed multiple times since it first launched in 2004. doves latest campaign once again highlighted the core message, going far beyond surface aesthetic to focus on the beauty of real human values. the courage is beautiful campaign successfully honored the healthcare workers who have been working selflessly throughout the 2020 pandemic.the fact remains that the share of mind and voice are key elements to being the dominant force in the world today. social media marketing has leveraged all the elements and made its presence felt in every customer engagement. finding unique ways to really stand out among the competition is key to a successful digital marketing strategy. newer and more customized tools to feel the pulse of the market come up every single day, to meet the ever-changing needs of marketing heads. at the end of the day, customer is indeed king. and companies would do well to remember it!blackcoffer insights 19: debmalya banik chowdhury(xlri jamshedpur)& tanisha gupta(xlri delhi)","['social', 'medium', 'staple', 'evolving', 'digital', 'culture', 'almost', 'hard',

11,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/impacts-of-covid-19-on-streets-sides-food-stalls/,Impacts of COVID 19 on Streets Sides Food Stalls - Blackcoffer Insights,"petty entrepreneurs like streetside food stalls form an essential part of an economy that plays a significant role in balancing the development of a nations economy. the importance of street food vendors not only helps in increasing the countrys per capita income but also helps to make a living for the unemployed in society with a limited investment. most of them are the sole breadwinners for their families. so, with the covid-19 wreaking havoc, the uncertainty of the lockdown policies increased the concern of people over hygiene and the lack of investment to upgrade their businesses to provide better hygiene facilities that can take away food from their mouths.various states have provided relief packages and support but, in a country, as populous as ours, it has hardly been appropriately implemented. delhi, for instance, recently announced a rupee 500 million stimulus package to nearly 500,000 rupees, recognizing the severe consequences of the loss of livelihoods. the sellers intended remedy is a credit loan that provides all sellers with an initial working capital of rs 10,000, but this is not enough. instead of loans, the government should consider converting them directly into income benefits, cash subsidies to secure a livelihood in order to initiate income-generating activities on a regular basis. sellers need income support to get back to work, and if they cant, they will never be able to repay the loan amount. in an ever-changing crisis, organizations need to take a step forward and ensure that providers are provided with the resources they need to make a living. pandemics have had a vast economic impact on every sector, but the most vulnerable sectors, such as street vendors, suffer the most. decreased income can affect most necessities, such as payments to family and yourself. due to a lack of fixed salaries, stalls cannot quit their jobs. if possible, it might be only a few days, unlike regular employees. for them, the risk of infection is far less frightening than hunger.unlike many of the businesses, most of these food vendors lack the infrastructure to go online and sell products through platforms like swiggy or zomato.regret not going digital before, says dilip das, a street side food stall owner at sector v, kolkata. dilip das used to run a small streetside food stall that provided meals to all the employees around the area which is filled with multinational companies. it was a booming business till the arrival of covid. then with the lockdown arriving, almost all the companies opted for work from home policies. dilip tried to start deliveries, but with a lack of support and fear of infection, that business ended before it even started.citing similar reasons, swapan mondal, who runs a south indian food stall at park street said that he did know how to operate a smartphone. and since sales were good, he did not care about learning either. but with the implementation of lockdown which took place within 4 hours, people like swapan barely had time to cope with the changes.furthermore, the covid 19 pandemic made people realize how important trains are in our life. with most of the train network suspended, the entire supply chain was disrupted. hundreds of quintals of food products rotted away, awaiting the logistical issues to fix. many businesses could not afford to run without proper supplies as well.to handle such issues, vendors organizations may consider the following solutions:promotion of livelihood for all vendors, including sellers of non-essential goodsthe impact of covid19 was extremely severe for informal workers who ran out of capital and income and to try to feed themselves during this long embargo. sellers need to be able to resume sales in order to survive, and governments need to take steps to reopen the market and bring sellers back to the business.reopening of markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygieneindia has different types of traditionally crowded markets, even weekly markets (fresh food, cooked food, and essentials) and daily roadside markets. these markets have to reopen with the need for social distance in mind, and the government needs to publish guidelines for that. in the future, sales areas will also need to be designed with social distance and the need for adequate sanitation (running water, wash areas, toilets) in mind. authorities need to work with the town bending commission (tvc).provision of direct support that is devoid of existing registration requirementsonce the restrictions are lifted and the impact of covid 19 is somewhat manageable, sellers who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to help them to return to work. the government initiative is a welcome move, but not in terms of the type of bailout and eligibility is enough. in addition, there are very few registered providers in india, so government relief and support must be separated from the very strict registration requirements. in delhi alone, of the approximately 300,000 street vendors, only approximately 13100 have some sort of professional id. if all types of cash grants or livelihood support standards relate to job identification by the state, the government must also accept registration with workers organizations/unions on behalf of government-issued sales badges.ensuring social distancing and proper sanitation and hygiene at sites of businessesthe government and municipal corporations need to take the initiative and running water, and soap/sanitizers need to be provided for street vendors at their place of work. moreover, the streetside food vendors should work with food safety authorities in the country to train themselves in different ways to maintain hygiene whilst working.taking steps to spread awareness of different government initiatives and reliefsmany small businessmen and food vendors do not even know their rights and the benefits they can claim. if they did, many still have no idea about how to claim them. proper awareness camps need to be set up to help these small-time food vendors to know how they can get assistance and help from the government and return back to the business.when covid was an unknown word, these shopkeepers and vendors brought the taste to our mouth, gave us memories to live for, filled our bellies, and quenched our thirst when we needed them. its time to provide them with a hand now when they need it.","['petty', 'entrepreneur', 'like', 'streetside', 'food', 'stall', 'form', 'essential', 'part', 'economy', 'play', 'significant', 'role',

12,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/coronavirus-impact-on-energy-markets-2/,Coronavirus impact on energy markets - Blackcoffer Insights,"the coronavirus, also known as covid-19, is not only a global public health emergency but also a source of significant regional and increasingly global economic disruption. this impacts the energy and climate world in many ways.the economic downturn puts pressure on global oil prices leading the organization of petroleum exporting countries (opec) to consider further cuts to production. it hurts the demand for natural gas during a time of extremely low prices.it changes the economic,energy, and climate policymaking environment in china, one of the most consequential energy consumers and sources of greenhouse gas emissions. and it has temporarily disrupted supply chains throughout the energy industry, including renewable energy, at a time when supply chain connections with china were being revaluated due to ongoing tariff and trade disputes. how consequential or transformative any of these changes are for the energy sector or for climate efforts will depend upon the ultimate trajectory of the virus outbreak itselfsarah ladislaw, senior vice president and director,energy security and climate change programthe energy sector has already felt the impacts of the coronavirus. the outbreak has contributed to a dampened demand for oil, resulting in plummeting oil prices and production declines. as we move forward, then, the energy sector expects to face two headwinds: managing the issues of the health emergency all sectors face, and simultaneously coping with a low oil-price scenario, lower demand and the need to shore up revenue and manage debt obligations. impact of covid-19 on indian energy marketsin india, distribution utilities have a lower tariff for domestic and agricultural consumers, sometimes even below the average cost of supply, as compared to that for commercial and industrial consumers. table 1 provides the electricity tariff rates in delhi for selected consumer categories to highlight these differences. thus, for several distribution companies, the lower tariff-paying consumers are cross-subsidized by commercial and industrial consumers.categoryfixed charge (/kva/month)energy charge (/kwh)industrial2507.75single point delivery supply for group housing societies1504.50agriculture1251.50table: electricity tariff schedule for fy(2019-20) delhi electricity regulatory commission (derc)the covid-19 lockdown has led to shut down of all but essential commercial activities across the country. approximately 1.3 billion citizens are obliged to remain within the confines of their homes and, in many cases, only allowed to work from home. consequently, the electricity demand from industrial and, commercial customers has reduced significantly while the residential demand is expected to have increased. according to the power system operation corporation of india (posoco), the energy met on march 16th, 2020 which can be considered as a business-as-usual scenario was 3494 mu as compared to 3113 mu on march 23rd, 2020 a day of voluntary curfew.it further reduced to a range between 2600-2800 mubetween march 25thto march 31st, 2020. this trend is illustrated in the below figure 1.figure1: daily energy met (mu)thus, firstly, a key risk from the covid-19 pandemic for the already struggling distribution companies in india arises from the loss of revenues due to the reduction of demand from the commercial and industrial customers as well as the inability to cover the cross-subsidies provided to the lower-tariff paying consumer. secondly, the utilities would also have to account for the expense to comply with any must buy commitments that they have with generators with long-term power purchase agreements. the true and full extent of this risk would only be known once a quantitative analysis is conducted when this crisis situation is contained. thirdly, at an operational level, distribution companies would have to account for deviation in demand and supply patterns at a temporal and locational level. finally, during this period, critical infrastructure such as electricity networks would have to be run with minimum employees.covid-19 impact on the power marketas seen in figure 1, the trade on the wholesale power market comprises just 4.3 percent of the total electricity transactions. however, the transactions through the power exchanges have grown over the last decade. the indian energy exchange (iex)has seen a growth from 2616 mu in fy 2009 to 52,241 in fy 2019.figure2: share of market segments in total electricity generation 2018-19 (source: cerc)until now, the trade in the wholesale market is in four market segments:1) day-ahead market2) term ahead market3) renewable energy certificates4) energy-saving certificates.recently, the central electricity regulatory commission (cerc) finalized the regulations for implementing real-time markets. thishalf-hourly marketwill enable the intra-day trade of electricity, allowing adjustment of generation and consumption profile during the day. before the covid-19 pandemic, it was announced by cerc that the real-time market would be operational from april 1st, 2020. however, the starting date has now been delayed by two months to june 1st, 2020.according to media reports, due to the covid-19 pandemic, some required trials could not be completed. this delay in the real-time market implementation is likely to have a serious, adverse impact on the indian power market.another impact of the covid-19 pandemic on the power markets is in terms of the market dynamic. it can be observed that there is a dip in the clearing volume and the market-clearing price, which coincides with the gradually increasing shutdown measures taken by the government as a response to covid-19 (see figure 2). thus, the reduction in demand due to the lockdown is reflected in the volumes traded on the electricity market and the clearing price.another point of reference is the price and clearing volume in 2019. on march 22nd, 2020, the day of voluntary lockdown, the clearing volume was 97.05 gwh, and the clearing price was 2195.48 /mwh. in comparison,on the same day in 2019, the clearing volume was 107.98 gwh, and the clearing price was 2816.18 /mwh. from the start of the lockdown, from march 25nd to april 1st 2020, the average clearing volume was 104.27 gwh compared to 130.24 gwh in 2019 during the same period. similarly,the average market clearing pricewas 2155.93 /mwh in 2020 as compared to 3371.025 /mwh in 2019 for the same period. views of the shareholders in indiathe lockdown has resulted in a shutdown of the industrial and commercial establishments and the stoppage of passenger railway services. this has adversely impacted the all india electricity demand, given that these segments constitute about 40% of the all india electricity demand, a statement issued by the rating firm said.further, these segments account for an even greater percentage of the discoms sales revenues given that they are the subsidizing segments. this apart, with the focus of state governments being on healthcare and relief measures, the likelihood of subsidy support to the discoms getting deferred cannot be ruled out, it added.icra ratings group head and senior vice president corporate ratings sabyasachimajumdar said, the lockdown imposed by the government is likely to adversely impact the all india electricity demand, with demand expected to decline by about 20-25% on a year-on-year basis during the period of lockdown. this would in turn adversely impact the revenues and cash collections for distribution utilities in the near term, especially given the consumption decline from the high tariff paying industrial and commercial consumers and likely delays in cash collections from other consumer segments. the revenue deficit for the discoms is estimated to be about rs. 130 billion per month, on an all india basis. this would in turn adversely impact the liquidity profile of the discoms, increase their subsidy requirement, and lead to delays in payments to the power generation and transmission companies.the power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companies.the power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companies and requested state governments to issue similar directions to state electricity regulators.the power generation companies are already suffering delays in payments by discoms across the majority of states, with payment due of more than rs 85000 crore as of november 2019 at all india level as per the data on praapti portal.with covid-19 lockdown accentuating the delays in payments, the availability of adequate liquidity buffer in the form of debt service reserve and undrawn working capital limits remains important from a credit perspective.however, it said that relief measures such as a moratorium on debt servicing over a 3-month period as notified by reserve bank of india and expected moderation in the interest rate cycle would be a source of comfort in the near term. the timely approval of the moratorium by the boards of the banks and financial institutions remains crucial.the revenues for power generation companies having long-term power purchase agreements (ppas) with the state distribution utilities (discoms) will be protected by the provision for capacity charges linked to plant availability in case of thermal and large hydropower projects and must-run status in case of nuclear and renewable power projects.average monthly thermal plf would further dip to 50-52% against 63% in the corresponding period of the previous year, due to a considerable drop in demand and consequently, power generation companies especially those without any long-term ppas would be adversely impacted given the weakening of the power tariffs in the short-term / power exchange market, said icra ratings sector head & vice president girishkumarkadam.the under-construction renewable power projects as well as epc and manufacturing companies in the solar segment are likely to face execution delays because of disruption in the supply chain in india and labor availability, following the lockdown. given the import dependency on china for sourcing pv modules, the execution timelines for the ongoing solar projects are likely to be affected by delays in the delivery of pv modules following the outbreak of covid 19 in china.this delay in turn would increase the pre-operative expenses and the overall project cost, which in turn would have an impact on the expected returns.in this context, the mnre has notified that time extension can be provided for all renewable energy projects, which are impacted by the supply chain disruption due to the covid outbreak, under the force majeure clause.given the execution headwinds amid covid 19 affecting q1 of fy2020-21 and assuming the normalcy thereafter, the capacity addition in the wind and solar segments together is likely to degrow by about 25%, thus estimated at about 8 gw against earlier estimates of 11 gw in fy2020-21, said kadam.

(sars-cov-2) emerged in the city of wuhan, china. the disease called covid-19 spread to almost every nation in the world creating widespread havoc and disruption in routine life. who recognized it as a pandemic on march 10, 2020. as of april 19, 2020, worldwide around 24 lakh people have been infected and more than 1.6 lakh people have succumbed to covid-19.though a vaccine hasnt been developed yet, the spread of coronavirus can be stopped by washing hands frequently, covering ones mouth while coughing, and practicing social distancing from other people. countries across the world are using lockdowns as an effective way to stop the spread.29 kb of rna has brought the world down to its knees. one-third of the global population has been in lockdown. schools, colleges, businesses, services that are considered non-essential have been put on hold for an indefinite period. even after lifting restrictions, a global recession even worse than the one in 2008 is going to be expected.now arriving at the main field of discussion, i.e. hospitality industry. how covid-19 impact hospitality?propulsion was building for 2020 to be a year of focal collective action on sustainability. the covid-19 outbreak has emphasized more than ever, the importance of future-proofing business for growth and resilience.the hospitality industry includes various services like lodging, food and beverage, events, tourism, transportation, theme parks, etc. before covid 19 prevailed, we all know that this industry was in much demand and was also one of the major sources of the rising economy. during vacation and festive periods, these were always full of people worldwide. as of now, due to the havoc created and ongoing lockdown they are bearing many losses and is one of the main reason for the decreasing economy.have you ever thought of hotels been converted into hospitals, quarantine centers, and isolation centers? yes, my dear people! amidst this outbreak, many of the hospitality industry properties, be it tiny or enormous have come forward to help the nation fight this life-menacing virus.taj hotel in mumbai is attentively aware of its responsibility towards the community and has opened its doors for the major frontline workers, i.e. medical fraternities to stay at their place while they combat the spread of this treacherous virus.also, many of the government bodies have been transformed to provide shelter to the homeless. recently, in vadodara gujarat the building which was built for the employees aiming to work for the major mumbai-ahmedabad bullet train project has been come forward to make it an isolation center for doctors and nurses.railways the lifeline of citizens. as railways have started their service years ago, from that period they are being considered as the lifeline of citizens in many metropolitan cities. today at the time of the global pandemic, railways havent backed off from the position of the lifeline. yes, my dear friends, you have heard it right! railway coaches in india have been turning into the hospital and isolation centers, marking their presence by helping the government to increase the number of isolation beds. also, many special parcel express trains are running in the entire nation to fulfill the needs of people by transporting essential commodities and goods.hospitality has been one of the most innovative industries in the crisis so far. connections have been rapidly formed to donate food and beverages to local charities from various hotels. many of the hospitality bodies are standing in solidarity with the communities affected by this threatening disease by lighting their windows in the shape of a heart, seen in hotels across the world.with this outbreak, there is a sharp drop in tourists worldwide as the aviation, railways and public transport buses have come to a standstill due to severe government restrictions.today it is clear that hospitality industries must be prepared for various situations like a pandemic, climate change, etc. as of now they are facing devastating and disastrous covid-19 impact on its various sectors.the debt being the normal capital intensive component has to be serviced by payment of interest on debt and repayment of debt. hotels being labor-intensive, have lots of fixed costs such as wage bills, besides paying government levies, minimum load charges, etc. the earlier indian hospitality industry was on average witnessing 65 to 70% of occupancy till the end of february. the first few days of march were fine, once things started accelerating, the occupancy has gone down to a severe minimum. also as soon as the pandemic ends by gods grace, the hospitality industry will still face some loss as the tourists will be much lesser in the beginning months.as soon as the crisis gets over, the hospitality industry will have a very crucial role to play in rehabilitating lives within their local communities. millions of people will be unemployed leaving them at high risk of poverty and exploitation. as the industry starts to recover, hospitality will be one of the sources to increase employment to the needy ones taking the poverty level to a minimum.within india, after the crisis over, people should travel to the less known and highly economically affected destinations to help the hospitality industry overcome the loss they bore due to covid-19.hence, the hospitality industry suffered and is suffering a lot due to this pandemic and despite that, it is also helping the nation to win against this dangerous disease. thus covid-19 impact on hospitalitylets be grateful to all the frontline workers saving the entire nation and also be thankful to all the various sectors of the hospitality industry who have come forward to help and serve the nation.soon we will fight this!stay home! stay safe! jay hind! blackcoffer insights 17: ejankhalifa and uma kanetkar (gujarat)","['december', 'novel', 'coronavirus', 'strain', 'sars', 'cov', 'emerged', 'city',

14,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/lessons-from-the-past-some-key-learnings-relevant-to-the-coronavirus-crisis-4/,key learnings relevant to the coronavirus crisis | Lessons from the past,"as a race, we are not ready for any kind of crisis. we have fire extinguishers in buildings, but barely any knowledge of how to use it. we convince ourselves that we are prepared but in the face of adversity we stand dumbfounded and give the simplest excuse, that of being in unprecedented times. the same thing has happened with the coronavirus crisis. if we look back, we can see that this crisis was not avoidable. there was a lot we could have done, but because we underestimated it so much, the situation has now blown out of proportion and cost us thousands of lives, millions of jobs and a massive hit to the world economy. we may be in a unique condition but there is still a lot that we can apply from past experiences and previous calamities.first, lets look at this in a reflective mode. what are the things we could have done to avoid this crisis in the first place? controlling the origin of a virus is difficult but preventing it from spreading is not. one of the biggest contributors to this unforgiving crisis is the lack of communication or even worse, the propagation of fake news. take india for example. clear communication about the virus was only initiated after a few cases had been identified. we were aware of the hazards of this virus since before and should have acted sooner. the spread of accurate and timely information is a must. if we had spread awareness earlier, we could have controlled the number of cases better, like new zealand and ireland have done. secondly, in a situation of crisis, the first thing to spread is fake news. it is imperative that the government, social media agencies and people themselves act more responsibly. since there is no accurate and transparent information, a lot of uncertainty exists in the society. this impacts the confidence of consumers and investors in the market, which in turn leads to an economic slowdown. past experiences with financial breakdowns and recessions have shown us that retain market trust can only occur with transparency and accuracy of information. organisations should have acted earlier and communicated more effectively with their employees.moreover, we must also understand that specific sectors take the hardest hit during lockdowns. as we have witnessed in earlier lockdowns, curfews, national emergencies and pandemics, the first segment of society to take a hit is the daily wagers and labourers. not only do the prices of goods increase but their income also takes a decline in such a crisis. in such situations, they cant even afford basic amenities. india witnessed a mass exodus recently, with thousands of people trying to return to their villages on foot. this only leads to more chaos and a decline in containment of the disease. the government should have accounted for such factors before announcing a lockdown with a four hour notice. they could have made better arrangements for food and water in the metro cities itself or giving them safer means to travel home.this is something that they can still include in their relief programs.government intervention is a must right now. this can be done in two ways. first, is to create more employment opportunities. governments used this strategy in the sars and ebola virus emergency. health, water, sanitation and hygiene are the most services in the times of health emergencies. intense investment for these services and infrastructure can provide immediate jobs. secondly, if governments use fiscal and monetary policy to fuel demand and maintain current living standards, it can decrease the propensity of a huge fall in economic growth. a fiscal stimulus by the government can make all the difference. having better avenues for cash transfers, easier loans and more exchange will automatically help. a fall in the growth rate is unavoidable as lots of sectors have no choice but to pause all work. however, industries that can provide high returns even now must be encouraged. for example, it sector, health, food and agriculture, etc.moreover, governments and businesses should use the most important tool in their hand, the internet! even in the times of physical social distancing, we are still connected to people across the world and are socialising at our normal rates. governments should use these mediums to maintain public spirit, communicate policy strategies and inform people. businesses should use these means to continue working and maintain employee morale. to have balanced crisis management and to prevent panic in the masses, social dialogue and engagement at every level is imperative. use these mediums to educate people about the importance of social distancing, hygiene and steps to be followed.all diseases are different and the scientific approach to tackle them varies. however, with most epidemics and pandemics some common steps can be followed. our past experience with fast spreading diseases has shown that the easiest and most effective way to curb it is social distancing. countries have taken impressive steps to ensure social distancing and must keep this up for even a few weeks after curbing the disease. maintaining sanitary habits and hygiene can protect us from infections and increase our immunity. while governments and medical agencies look for ways to tackle the virus at a macro level, we must continue to follow all measures on an individual level too.we must also pay a lot of attention to mental and physical well-being now. in the past, when economies took a hit due to the 2008 recession or calamities, the first thing to break was peoples self-esteem. suicide rates, amount of domestic abuse and cases of depression increased manifold. we have to take effort and ensure that we try and live as much of a balanced life as possible. we should stay connected to our friends and not be ashamed of reaching out to others for help. social distancing is not easy and can take a toll on many. lots of special helplines have been set up for the same and people must use them if needed. governments have also given code words for victims of domestic abuse to report crimes in countries like france and spain. we must remember to stay mentally healthy and calm during a crisis as that is the most important thing.i dont believe that every crisis is the same. of course, there are a lot of unique things about the coronavirus pandemic that we had not expected to ever see. even though these are different times, there are still lots of things we can apply from our past experiences. we cannot find a cure for the virus but we can find ways to maintain the economy, our mental peace, and prevent the spread of the virus. the past has a lot to offer if we ponder. we must learn to understand the mistakes of the past and better them in the future. our past experiences with the different crises have taught us that fiscal stimuli work, maintaining employee morale is important and that social. engagement is imperative. if we use these tools efficiently, we can ensure that people only have to fight the virus and not worry about the multitude of repercussions that come with it.","['race', 'ready', 'kind', 'crisis', 'fire',

15,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/estimating-the-impact-of-covid-19-on-the-world-of-work-2/,Estimating the impact of COVID-19 on the world of work - Blackcoffer Insights,"covid-19 an unprecedented pandemic for us but a can-be possibility for great leaders such as bill gates came into action since the rising of the year 2020. the corollary of this pandemic is so prodigious that the analysis by the un department of economic and social affairs (desa) stated that the covid-19 pandemic is disrupting global supply chains and international trade which in turn could shrink the global economy by up to 1 percent in 2020, a reversal from the previous forecast of 2.5 percent growth. more than 6.6 million americans filed unemployment claims and the economic downturn is expected to be the worst recession since the great depression as stated by the imf. india is facing its biggest crisis in decades, with a three-week lockdown initially, but extending further in a nation of 1.3 billion people likely to result in an economic recession, millions of job losses and possible starvation among the poor. it can be said that economic contagion is now spreading as fast as the disease itself. on the contrary nature has pressed the reset button, the environment is having a noticeable benefit from this scenario. water is getting clearer, the air is turning breathable and various such news and pictures can be easily heard and seen on newspapers, telly, and social media platforms on day to day basis. but this is the storyline of the present, what about the future? are the predictions made by financial institutions and thought leaders going to be true? or something unexpected is going to happen that will make us think of our human capabilities again?after this storm of covid-19, it would not be a surprise to see how digitally every business will grow to provide better digital infrastructure and customer experience along with advancement in technology which we are lacking in this present scenario. the touch screens that we are using already will find its vast applications and would be seen in most of the places including hotels, hostels, and shopping malls. all those processes which are interdependent will take an agile turn resulting in better productivity of goods, having a systematic backup giving a better experience to the consumer even in hard situations. the major focus would be making contactless systems hence artificial intelligence and machine learning will become the most rapid and in-demand fields. not only this, but the medical infrastructure and services will also take a boost in the race of developing the systems to handle any situation afterward. the human to machine interaction will increase facilitating fast production, delivery and surveillance inculcating many more. in each and every area the covid will leave its mark may it be retail sector or may it be the banking sector making them modify or fully change their architectures.even the existing systems would be gifted with some modifications, ensuring them to work in a hard environment even with or without human intervention. the companies will rethink their policies shaping themselves accordingly to manage the resources ensuring safety, agility, and work to be a top priority. the work from home idea will also provide a base for bigger companies ensuring to develop a better infrastructure for their resources and probably giving birth to a new concept of work culture. various existing industries related to either delivery or travel may adopt the new idea of collaboration with other industries which will result in more options for consumers on their old routine apps.new businesses will root out from the existing ventures resulting in head to head competition in the business world but turning into a brownie point for consumer experience and bandwidth of choices. start-up culture will go hand in hand and expected to take a stupendous growth in the race of providing us a legitimate opportunity to use and feel the real digital world. the various innovations will now take a pace in each field and maybe we will hear some new jargons related to tech in upcoming years. since the global economy has fumbled, countries will now try to take a different turn to vamoose out of this phase. they will try to make new connections by nurturing a give and take relationship and several business relationships would take an unexpected move making the position of several countries sliding up and down on indexes. even rival countries may join their hands in this hard time rather than being dismissed totally under predator countries. it would be surprising to see how these scenarios will be handled by the emperor of minds and how their opponents are going to take it as an agenda for the next elections.unfortunately, the nature that is at its best will start to face the ill effects after the chart of development and economy will take a pace for exponential growth. it is unfortunate that the inverse relationship between economic growth and environmental destruction exists since carbon emission increases with economic development. as shown by the graph below whenever recession took place the carbon emission decreases along with other harmful gases, turning out as a gift for nature but doom for the financial markets.but there is a possibility that several start-ups now emerge with the idea of environment conservation collaborating with ngos innovating and using the best of their capability to reduce the ill effect from the present origin point.in the culmination we can say this pandemic is like blessing in disguise producing a massive impact not only on macro but also on micro-economy. the novel virus not only brought some unexpected results but also uncovered some of our loopholes and unlatched new opportunities for growth, forcing us to define ourselves in several new spheres. quite a while ago we all were chit-chatting about the digital era, how this is benefiting us, covid-19 revealed making us realize this was just the beginning of digital era and a lot is needed to happen in future. it is obvious that not only the indian economy but the global economy is facing and going to face the aftereffects however similar to a virus, the economy will also rise from deep grounds to a green candlestick with individual collaboration!the businesses will soon rise again, people will get back to their jobs, vendors will start getting profits and everything will fall into its places but now a megalithic competitive environment will rise which will grow till decades until nature again shows its color and we as a human abide with its outcomes, learning some new lessons and keeping this cycle of fall and growth running.

project:the belt and road initiative is a global development strategy adopted by the chinese government in 2013 involving infrastructure development and investments in nearly 70 countries and international organizations in asia, europe, and africa.curtailed connectivity after covid19:a devastating economic collapse of potentially historic proportions after covid19, leading to social and political turmoil in a number of countries, and curtailed connectivity. interestingly, the pandemic has exposed the risks and weaknesses of global interconnectedness, which will affect chinas bri.funding shortfall for briso far, bri has been powered primarily by china, whose growth rates were decreasing even before the outbreak. exports hit: with the united states and europe reeling from the pandemic, chinese exports will take a big hit.china confronts major risk of debt on belt and road due to pandemicchinas growth hit a near 30-year low of 6.1%roughly 5 million people in china lost their jobs in the first 2 months of 2020.last february, chinas official urban unemployment jumped to an unprecedented 6.2 percent. unemployed number may go up to 9 million by the end of 2020.china will have to choose out of two competing priorities:avoiding the middle-income trap,while at the same time posturing as a superpower abroad.so, not only may bri be short of cash, but it will also be hard to sell at homeall economies along bri routes affectedpakistan, host to the biggest bri megaproject in the world, is poised to sustain a $8.2 billion loss, according to adb. the respective figure for bangladesh is $3 billion. thailand is now bracing up for a recession. africa is equally vulnerable, as china is the continents largest market.covid19 hit chinese companies executing bri contracts can rely on support from the cdb in the form of low-cost financing. yet, chinese policy banks will be increasingly picky and inclined to stay away from new projects that may turn out to be loss-makers.china development bank to support belt and road companies hit by coronavirus -xinhuathe coronavirus and xi jinpings worldviewpriority list:no. 1 preserving the ccps powerno. 2 maintaining

alliances no. 8 terrestrial silk road economic belt no. 9 maritime silk roadno 10 reshape the global orderunder extreme circumstances, beijing will not consider the bri as important.is the bri finished then? short term: yes, bri will face troublein particular, the summer of 2020 may be a period of hibernation for several bri projects.the outbreak has brought chinese labor supplies and equipment imports along bri routes down to a tricklenot exactly!!! in fact, the initiatives fuzzy content is being further enriched with the health silk road add-on narrative and mask diplomacy in a major soft-power push.long term: a changed bri will emergethe bri is bound to change. strategies will change.it might even be defined properlyseven years after this ambitious initiative was announced it remains a blurred vision in need of a comprehensive conceptual framework, international standards, and a coherent implementation strategy.this is one of the reasons why the bri has become controversial and has caused a backlash in many countries.a shift away from roads and bridgesbri expenditure up to 2019 stood at $545 billion. (wb estimate) about two-thirds of spending on bri projects has gone into the energy sector and transporthowever, developing countries in need of infrastructure will be terribly cash-strapped, there may be a shift away from roads, bridges, and coalfired power plants funded through chinese loans.new bri projects will probably be more strategically chosen. beijing has been investing in the creation of a globe-spanning network of economic corridors, logistics zones, and financial centers, with stress laid on seaports and adjacent areas. egypts suez canal economic zone and sri lankas colombo port city clearly show this trend.
in addition, projects are likely to focus on more sophisticated forms of connectivity, such as 5g networks or, in the wake of the pandemic, disaster management, public health-related high-tech, and even remote surgery. china will surely use the bri for the projection of its soft power, an increasingly important battlefield in international relations.
the world has become aware of the risks of overwhelming reliance on china.

todays new reality.inquisitive about the conclusion? lets attempt to vindicate as the outline story unfolds itself.ever since the concept of gaming floated back in the 1970s a new dimension was put before human beings, intangible in nature, and paradoxically engulfed us since then. it laid an impact on multiple generations in different ways. the last decade witnessed a boom in this industry & with the advancement of technologies in virtual and augmented reality, the gaming world has become an integral part of our day to day experiences. with the intent of being regarded as a leisure activity, it has now percolated over various strata and has managed to gather the attention of teenagers and adolescents on a comprehensive scale.as we explored the fabric of our engineering batch mates, we came across this peculiar guy holding excellent academics with accolades of his names, seemed to be a nerd at a glance and street smart by nature. concomitance happened to be the reason for experiencing the lifestyle of other personalities that included sam as well.sam was not only fascinated by the games but used to spend tirelessly hours and hours in front of the white screen engrossed completely leaving the track of time. as our academics advanced, the intensity of involvement in gaming grew deeper and steadily it turned into addiction in no time. we realized the gravity as we were exposed to his change of behavior and shift of priorities due to his unprecedented absence during our lectures and practical. he was modestly reluctant to share about his whereabouts with his peers. the situation turned grim when he wasnt able to cope up with the subjects and was socially disturbed while interacting. he was compelled towards the fantasy world and was trapped in the vicious cycle of a never-ending backlog of games. as time progressed his performance turned from bad to worse. he was struggling. it was clear as ice that he had something hidden behind that visage.as sophomores, we were also involved in gaming but soon realized that it does more harm than good. a close cluster of friends decided to lend a helping hand to sam and as they learned about him, the ground beneath their feet slipped away and froze their brain. he had completely lost the circadian rhythm of his sleep, ran into financial losses, aggression draped him, his relations were tarnished due to the habitual routine, and signs of depression were visible on the upfront.poker was the tartar that he had caught. the game of cards as most of us would perceive it, rather proved to be the fulcrum of sams near future. in the quest of pleasure through online games, he entered the tunnel of gambling at a very tender age ignoring the risks involved in terms of financial verticals. he was suffering from internet gaming disorder (igd) & his condition deteriorated as days passed by. apparently, from a healthy individual to a drained skinny one, it took a toll on his physical health. mental disturbance sucked him and he grew insensitive towards his academics. the psychological negative consequences were due to the combination of online gaming and gambling platforms. during that phase, the peer group (gaming group) gained more influence than parental control.days arrived when he ran short of money and went ahead to ask his friends in college for the funds. since a large amount of money is involved in gambling, a situation exacerbated when sam had his ethical values on the line and breached his boundaries to satisfy his hunger of gaming and leaped towards illegal means to fund his gambling.the practical project was a crucial part of our engineering curriculum, under which a team of four members was to be established and is expected to remain intact for a year. sam was by no means in anyones good books. no one in the batch was ready to risk with sam even though he possessed a brilliant acumen. he was abandoned. we were three friends already and were scouting for the fourth. with mutual consensus, we decided to go ahead with sam. initially, we worked together and collaboration seemed to be perfect. unfortunately, he wasnt able to clear his backlog exams and had to drop out. at present he plays poker on a professional level, keeping aside his engineering career and battling with his conscience that we may not be aware of.earlier generations used to spend their time or rather invest their time into activities building up their passion, in some cases they pushed their cognition to such an extreme and contributed to a level that humanity as a whole is in-depth to date. can we imagine our present without the existence of sir edison, sir newton, sir tesla, sir einstein, and many more that were engrossed in their domain and served the necessary impetus for our generation? no one knows that sam could have been our generation scientist, hadnt he chose that path.not everyone is sam but perhaps we could miss our einstein or tesla! maybe our newton is waiting for the new upgraded version of the game instead of sitting under the tree. our mendeleev might be involved in arcade games!feels so numb.millions of teenagers are involved in online gaming platforms and the community is growing at a rapid rate every year. presently the prevalence of igd among the adolescent group was between 1.3% to 19.9% and males reported more prevalence than females. in the fiscal year 2019, there were 300 million online gamers in india. this number was estimated to go up to 440 million gamers by the fiscal year 2022. overall, india ranked the highest in terms of the growth in online game downloads on app stores with a growth rate of 165 percent between 2016 to 2018. 75% of young people use a mobile phone to play different games, 21% use pc/laptop. games like pubg that promote virtual violence calls for the stern attention of the responsible demographics. as per a study, online games are directly affecting the neurons, leading to chemical imbalance thus causing severe depression and anxiety attacks.as per the world health organization, depression is interrelated to physical and mental health and the word depression that didnt exist decades back has become prevalent among the youth, leading to more stress and dysfunction and worsening the affected persons life situation.anything in excess is poison. so are games.in deed the virtual illusion has become todays new reality.blackcoffer insights 18: aftaab sara(m.tech,iit delhi) and furquan shaikh(mba)","['perhaps', 'virtual', 'illusion', 'become', 'today', 'new', 'reality', 'inquisitive', 'conclusion',

Insights,"epidemics, in general, have both direct and indirect costs associated with direct and indirect measures adopted to counter (control) the epidemic which generally have both short-run and long-run economic and social consequences. the 2019 coronavirus (covid-19) outbreak globally lead a significant setback to the entire globe. the first case was detected on 26th december 2019 in china. the world health organization (who) prepared the first diagnostic kit on 14th january 2020.as the global coronavirus or covid-19 pandemic continues to take hold every economy is feeling its effect with a high degree of uncertainty taking a toll in all the manufacturing sectors. supply chain management is an important area with many opportunities for our community to contribute in various forms. according to the data produced by supply managements report on business show that pmi (purchasing managers index) has declined 1% in the month of february. mainly there has been a huge contraction in the petroleum, transportation and textile industries. although there has been a fall in the inventory but is expected to grow due to supply chain disruptions leading to inefficiencies in material conversion and continued advanced stocking to protect production schedules. a analysis by trading platform forex claimed that heavily 75% of all companies had already reported supply chain disruptions with more than 80% believing that at some point they would experience impacts as a result of covid-19 disruptions. the effective shutdown of industrial activity i.e. china, ground zero for the virus presented particularly difficult problems for manufacturing firms worldwide. imported goods invested by investors set a significant setback.several experiments were carried out by different governments across the globe to restrict the spread of this pandemic. boris johnson introduced the herd immunity plan in the united kingdom which was a failure followed by a mitigate model which india also tried initially to stop the spread of the covid-19 virus. the last and the ultimate model that most of the countries are applying is the hammer and the dance model i.e. the lockdown model which is estimated to bring down the caseload by 25-30%. the lockdown model basically means buying time to prepare the vaccine to kill the virus.however, the lockdown has certain critical economic consequences which add to the burden of global distress. this can be explained using the standard macroeconomic keynesian model. the lockdown and the spread of the disease have a direct negative shock on aggregate consumption levels and exports. this leads to a contraction in aggregate demand which leads to a fall in the market rate of interest and aggregate equilibrium output. the secondary effect on the commodity market is via investment demand function which can either increase owing to a fall in the market rate of interest, or fall owing to the contraction in aggregate demand. clearly, the contraction of the aggregate demand-side generates an economic slowdown. on the other hand, restriction of workers gathering in the workplace owing to lockdown hurts the production in those sectors which need the presence of physical workers. note that software or financial service-producing sectors are exempted from such negative supply shock at least in the short-run to medium-run since those works could be easily carried out based on work from home anthem. however, reverse migration of workers is an indication of a sharp cut down in production activities. this aggregate supply shock leads to the situation of stagflation. in recent announcements by the reserve bank of india (rbi) to ease liquidity in the system may prove to be counterproductive provided the aggregate supply shock, since the escalation of demand specifically for non-traded products without an adequate increase in production (supply) would only result in inflation. in other words, supply-side management must go hand in hand with demand-side policies. even if policies are undertaken at the national level by the government, however, conditions may not improve much due to shocks in the external sector through trade in commodities. most imports are banned which will increase the economic cost of production of import substitutes within the domestic territory based on the theory of comparative advantage in a ricardian sense. at the same time, exports are hurt due to lower demand from the developed economies. this shows that unemployment and inflation are inevitable in the near future.corona virus has mainly affected raw material export-driven countries. with the covid-19 virus in the backdrop there will be a decline in new orders, production, and employment with ease in supplier deliveries as demand will be less with a mild decline in the inventories. there has been a huge revenue impact. long stretches of empty supermarket shelves and shortage of essential commodities are only the visible impacts to consumers of the global chain disruption caused by the covid-19 pandemic. the uncertainties ahead swing between extremes. as the shortages worsen before they get resolved prices of many commodities could go up for consumers even if laws exist against price gouging. at the same time we should keep in mind that constrained supplies could cause a decline in demand which in turn may end up weakening prices. risk management process is not robust enough to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. the seemingly relentless forces of globalization and technology with coronavirus in the backdrop will present us with new supply chain challenges and opportunities for further progress in the near future. there is a glimmer of good news as countries globally haven taken preventive measures but the recovery may be fragile.the crisis due to the global pandemic is likely to be more serious for developing economies compared to the global financial crisis of 2008. this is due to the fact that the global financial crisis leads to lower demand for exports from the developing economies by the developed nations which further lead to contraction of export-based industries and other sectors in the developing nations due to inter-sectoral backward and forward linkage effect, however, the burden of retrenchments in the formal sector was absorbed in the informal sector. in the present situation, the problem of vanishing informal sector is evident since informal sector workers are more vulnerable to the spread of the disease due to the absence of non-regulatory authority and out of direct government control. moreover, lockdown lead to massive close down of this informal units, thus the informal sector in this present set up is vanishing due to which the shock absorption capacity of developing economy like india is becoming weaker. the global economy is drowning towards deep cycles of economic depression and the aftershocks seem to be long-lasting. the only way of this global shock seems to be international policy coordination in line with the needs of the domestic economies","['epidemic', 'general', 'direct', 'indirect', 'cost', 'associated', 'direct',

Insights,"covid 19 has bought the world to its knees. with businesses being shut, travel being banned, schools, and colleges being closed, we have observed an impeccable amount of sorrow and despise along with a great amount of mental torture and destruction. though situations are improving now, and the lockdowns are being lifted, it is a fact that it cannot be shunned that this virus will have a long term impact on people, and the effects will not only be felt economically and physically but also mentally.weve been reading articles regarding the impact of covid 19 on the economy, education, mental health, and every other possible aspect. but one topic which has not been talked about much is the impact of covid 19 on office space and co-working industries. well, it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now, but, the covid period hasnt ended. this means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices; where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space. the same will be the condition in co-working industries, wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roof.however, these problems are quite obvious (though people havent thought about them much), but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters; but it also extends to metal space, or for that fact, space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinions.coronavirus has left a big scratch in our country; just the way a car needs repair after an accident, our country will also need repair after the control of this virus. but, unlike a car, our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any support.needless to say, the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason. but the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce, it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees. while some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly, others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salary.people tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition. the problem doesnt arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other, but instead, it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others. and in todays world, where people keep money at the top of their priority list, comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their company.since there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies, there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company; who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary. this may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better, but however, will bring huge losses in the long run. the fact is; employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their bosss eyes.moreover, since there will be comparisons among the employees, it might happen that the employee of the month ends up being hated by all other employees in the company. another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending; wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they dont. this might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around, and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office. in fact, employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities; which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their best.such situations will definitely arise in companies and offices; wherein employees will compete for attention and resources; which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning. and all this will happen because of only one thing; lack of office mental space i.e. space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork, along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some time.another kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the long-lasting impact of covid 19 is the co-working industry and offices. this is because, there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people, but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure, as well the rent will remain the same. because of this, employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest; to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used. however, the number of resources will be the same, and so, there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same.if the above two situations happen to occur at the same time (which they most likely will), we will observe a scene of intra-company as well as inter-company competition. also, our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition; which itself will be a result of limited mental space.covid 19 will have severe impacts on the office (mental) space of companies and people. peoples thoughts, how they treat others, along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyones lives. moreover, we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists; because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment. however, we need to cope with this thing and realize that it is indeed very important for us to start preparing to expand our mental space and that this competition and comparison will not stay for long and should not affect our personal relations and life at any cost.","['covid', 'bought', 'world', 'knee', 'business', 'shut', 'travel', 'banned', 'school', 'college', 'closed', 'observed',

24,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-will-covid-19-affect-the-world-of-work-2/,How will COVID-19 affect the world of work? - Blackcoffer Insights,"as business close to help prevent transmission of covid-19, financial concerns and job losses are one of the first human impacts of the virus;not knowing how this pandemic will play out also affects our economic, physical and mental well-being;despite this fear, businesses and communities in many regions have shown a more altruistic response in the face of crisis actions which could help countries preparing for covid-19.covid-19 is in decline in china. there are now more new cases every day in europe than there were in china at the epidemics peak and italy has surpassed it as the country with the most deaths from the virus it took 67 days to reach the first 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide, 11 days for this to increase to 200,000and just four to reach 300,000 confirmed cases a figure now exceeded.the human consequencesin recent weeks, we have seen the significant economic impact of the coronavirus on financial markets and vulnerable industries such as manufacturing, tourism, hospitality and travel.travel and tourism account for 10% of the global gdp and 50 million jobs are at risk worldwide.global tourism, travel and hospitality companies closing down affects smes globally. this, in turn, affects many people, typically the least well-paid and those self-employed or working in informal environments in the gig economy or in part-time work with zero-hours contracts. some governments have announced economic measures to safeguard jobs, guarantee wages and support the self-employed, but there is a lack of clarity in many countries about how these measures will be implemented and how people will manage a loss of income in the short-term.behind these statistics lie the human costs of the pandemic, from the deaths of friends and family to the physical effects of infection and the mental trauma and fear faced by almost everyone. not knowing how this pandemic will play out affects our economic, physical and mental well-being against a backdrop of a world that, for many, is increasingly anxious, unhappy and lonely.fear of the unknown can often lead to feelings of panic, for example when people feel they are being denied life-saving protection or treatment or that they may run out of necessities, which can lead to panic buying.psychological stress is often related to a sense of a lack of control in the face of uncertainty.in all cases, lack of information or the wrong information, either provided inadvertently or maliciously, can amplify the effects. there is a huge amount of misleading information circulating online about covid-19, from fake medical information to speculation about government responses. people are susceptible to social media posts from an apparently trustworthy source, often referred to as an uncle with a masters-post, possibly amplified and spread by copypasta posts, which share information by copying and pasting and make each new post look like an original source, as opposed to posts that are liked or shared or retweeted.sadly, criminals and hackers are also exploiting this situation and there has been a significant rise in coronavirus-themed malicious websites, with more than 16,000 new coronavirus-related domains registered since january 2020. hackers are selling malware and hacking tools through covid-19 discount codes on the darknet,many of which are aimed at accessing corporate data from home-workers laptops, which may not be as secure as outside an office environment.social distancing and lockdowns have also prompted altruistic behaviors, in part because of the sense that were all in this together. many people report being bored or concerned about putting on weight;others have discovered a slower pace of life and by not going out and socializing have found more time for family, others, and even their pets.the downside of self-isolation or social lockdown are symptoms of traumatic stress, confusion and anger, all of which are exacerbated by fear of infection, having limited access to supplies of necessities, inadequate information or the experience of economic loss or stigma. this stress and anxiety can lead to increased alcohol consumption, as well as an increase in domestic and family violence.in jingzhou, a town near wuhan in hubei province, reports of domestic violence during the lockdown in february 2020 were more than triple the number reported in february 2019.essential actions from the business communityhealth measures must be the first priority for governments, business and society. it is important for businesses to show solidarity and work together to protect staff, local communities and customers, as well as keeping supply chains, manufacturing and logistics working.according to research, my employer is more trusted than the government or media. daily updates on a company website with input from scientists and experts are recommended to counter politicized messages in the media and from governments. this is particularly true for large companies that have the capacity to do this.messages about what businesses are doing for their employees and in their communities is also important. some companies are helping schoolchildren from vulnerable families who can no longer get a school meal; others are providing public health messages about effective handwashing. even ceos can show they are working from home and self-isolating, while still being effective in their leadership.following who advice, there is a need for the business community to move from general support to specific actions and focus on countries access to critical supplies, including a community package of critical items (a list of 46 items that all countries need). of these items, 20 are either not available locally or available stocks are too limited. these missing items fall into four categories:hygiene: chlorine, hth 70%, alcohol based hand rub, liquid soap;diagnostics: lab screening tests, lab confirmation tests, enzymes, rna extraction kits;ppe: gowns, scrubs, aprons, sterile gloves, protective goggles, face shields, masks (n95 or ffp2);case management equipment: oxygen concentrators, oxygen delivery systems, mechanical ventilators.the call for action is for more money, to work with manufacturers to create capacity and to organize purchasing so there is guaranteed access, especially for poorer countries with less resilient public health systems. the concept is to create a global security stockpile of supplies and equipment, an effort that needs:emergency financingaccess to and increases in manufacturing capacityaccess to national and supplier stockpileswarehouses and distribution capacity","['business', 'close', 'help', 'prevent', 'transmission', 'covid', 'financial', 'concern', 'job', 'loss', 'one', 'first', 'human', 'impact',

Blackcoffer Insights,"so, not beginning with once upon a time because it is not a fairytale. before the advent of this deadly virus called coronavirus or with all love that we might want to call it covid-19, the life wasnt smooth as people are cribbing about.it is written by adam smith that human wants are endless and thus we know humans can never be satisfied. when we were busy and all the work and stressful lives, we all wanted breaks, we used t crib and cry about not getting time for family and friends. not having time for selfthis coronavirus outbreak had taught each one of us that :how important it is to be thankful for everything we have in our lives while sitting i just realize that how lucky we are that we do not have to go out amidst this crisis to work and earn bread. how sorry im for each the daily wage workers who have no other way but to go outthe second lesson is that we all can survive without fast food, we all are chefs and have made a lot of appealing and tasty dishes without spending a huge and bogus amount.the third lesson is family is everything, during this quarantine i realized that spending time with my family is so stress-busting and helps me be creative.we need to have other hobbies than going out and chilling.we need to look at the weather, its april and it is not that scorching heat we used to face, its lovely, nature is recovering. whenever i wake up in the morning i go to my terrace for yoga and find many families there, walking, gossiping, it has brought everyone close. mended relation.all the instagram stories make me realize that we all have talent just we dont have time to self introspect, we all are running in a race to be the best.from an economic point of view, though savings are leakage in the money flow but still savings are important for unforeseen circumstances.this lockdown has given us all time to reconnect and get together with all our loved ones, to do what we want.the main lesson is that we should enjoy life and every moment as it is. we never know what might happen to anyone. we never know who could be the last person we are talking to, last person we text, let us all be nice to each otherthere are many lessons that we have learned. one of them is the awareness about the cleanliness. the term cleanliness, that took modi ji about 5 years to teach people about swachh bharat abhiyan, a single case of the virus has taught everyone the importance of cleanliness and hygiene. corona virus crisis has taught how the humans at halt can lead the nature to work at itself.nature has its own mysteries and how what the humans have done to its beings is done to them, they are too imprisoned like the animals they have had imprisoned for years away from their homelands.this crisis has gaped the differences between the communities and brought the humans together.we can see a wave of excitement in everyone when modi ji gives his tasks. still, remember how my colony just rang up with the sound of bells and plates and claps. and how beautiful it looked with the balconies lit up with diyas and candles. it looked like diwali in the month of april but diwali with no pollution and noise.this crisis has made everyone of us thankful to the medical and nursing staff who had been working 247 hours , away from their families , so that we can stay safe with our families .it has just made me realize that we never know , if well see the sun tomorrow , if well see the people we love , if we can talk to them again , so lets not hold grudges and let the go and flow .corona virus has united all the humanity against a cause to defeat a virus, this virus has made the world a better place, there are no terror attacks, there are no rape cases, there are no murders, no loots. the earth is all healing.","['beginning', 'upon', 'time', 'fairytale', 'advent', 'deadly', 'virus', 'called', 'coronavirus', 'love', 'might', 'want', 'call', 'covid', 'life', 'wasnt', 'smooth', 'people', 'cribbing',

of every individual, it has also affected various industries for better or for worse. while certain industries like pharma, mobile and web-streaming industries, fitness and teleconference apps have boomed during this pandemic, industries like tourism, fast-food industry, retail and leisure sectors have suffered the worst hit due to coronavirus impactduring this lockdown to prevent the spreading of coronavirus impact, almost all of the companies have adopted a work-from-home culture and have used various teleconference apps to hold meetings. teleconference apps are also being used by college institutions and universities so that the studies dont get disrupted. also, confined to their homes, people have started engaging more in fitness apps, and web streaming services like netflix, youtube, and amazon prime are at their zenith.while these industries are thriving in this pandemic, the most affected industry during this time is the hospitality industry.hospitality industry embodies various sectors like transportation, traveling, airlines, hotels, and lodges, etc. hotels and traveling are also a major part of the tourism industry. the tourism and hospitality industries may appear somewhat similar, but they have their subtle distinctions. tourism mainly involves traveling and services to those who are away from home. the hospitality industry involves businesses and services that are concerned with leisure and enjoyment and mainly run on customer experience and satisfaction. their customers may also be local inhabitants along with tourists.the hospitality industry can be majorly divided into accommodations, travelling, and food and drinks. accommodations include hotels, resorts, hostels, motels, etc. the best of the hotels and resorts that were basking at their peeks, now have no option but to lay off their employees. many hotels are down to zero occupancies and have led to an immense loss for the hotel establishments. the same is the case for resorts, hostels, motels, etc. that provide accommodations. since there are no occupants, there is no money inflow, which is leading to the layoffs of employees as the owners are not able to provide paychecks anymore.businesses in the accommodation sector that have just started, are finding it difficult to cope up with this situation. various governments have extended small business bridge loans to cope up with this situation. the accommodations sector has no other way to cope with this situation but to wait for the situation to improve so that they can improve their business.traveling restrictions are imposed by various governments to avoid the spreading of coronavirus. travel agencies, car rentals, tour operators, flights, and airlines have been hit quite severely by covid-19. due to the fear of spreading coronavirus, people have limited their public outings or have stopped stepping out altogether unless to shop for daily essentials. coronavirus impact on travel that ban lays out restrictions on who can travel from where to where. many international and domestic flights have been suspended to tackle the coronavirus crisis. havoc is created across the aviation industry.the months from march to may are said to be the busiest times of the year for the tours and travel industry. but people are reluctant to travel in the fear of catching coronavirus or getting stuck abroad if the governments announce restrictions, thereby overstaying their visas that can imply their future travels abroad. airlines and tourism agencies have stopped marketing and advertising as it would be irresponsible and does not make sense during this crisis.to cope up with this situation, airlines like virgin atlantic and american airlines have started deploying passenger flights to carry cargo, while various airlines have laid off. commercial travel has dropped tremendously. also, there is a recent drop in jet fuel prices. it is being estimated that many airlines are going to go bankrupt if this situation persists.apart from airlines, the cruise industry and travel agencies also take a toll this year. they are facing cancellations of bookings, and some new travel agencies are at a risk of closing down rendering all their employees either losing their jobs or going on unpaid leaves in this time of crisis.it is predicted that once the pandemic is over or the situation is under control, the travel and tour industry can take about 10 months to return to normalcy. however, this outbreak may affect the entire tourism industrys future.many foods and drinks services fall under the hospitality industry as they offer people services that provide them leisure time. their customers not only include tourists but locals, passerbys, etc. these mainly include restaurants, tea and coffee shops, bars and pubs, catering, etc.catering is provided at places mainly where there is a social gathering, to deliver food and drinks services where it is not provided or not according to the organizers preference. due to this pandemic, many countries are in lockdown, and even those that are not in lockdown are not allowed to hold public gatherings as a safety precaution. due to the avoidance of public gatherings and events to maintain social distancing, catering services are halted for now.restaurants, tea and coffee shops, pubs, and bars have all closed down not only for the safety of their customers but also keeping in mind the safety of their employees and workers. however, a few restaurants that offer food delivery are still working, by taking all the necessary health and sanitation precautions to prevent the spreading of coronavirus. the number of such restaurants seems to be declining with the increasing cases of covid-19 as the customers are becoming more and more afraid and cautious about the situation. though, quick-service food deliveries can cope better than the full-service restaurants during this crisis.because of this unprecedented crisis, all these industries that are being affected are hoping for government support to make it through such tough times. without some financial support or help from the government or other institutions, it will be difficult for various establishments to survive through this crisis.it is being indicated that the world will face the worst recession since the great depression during this pandemic with so many people losing their jobs, especially those working in the hospitality industry. thus coronavirus impact on different industriesblackcoffer insights 17:- mehdia fatima,jamia millia

28,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-will-covid-19-affect-the-world-of-work-3/,How will COVID-19 affect the world of work? - Blackcoffer Insights,"a respiratory illness that started from patient zero in wuhan, a city in china, has now engulfed the entire globe in its clutches. with over 2 million confirmed cases and deaths north of 100,000, coronavirus, better known as covid-19, is a challenge unfathomed. history is earmarked with infections and diseases that ravaged continents time and againblack death decimated europe by claiming 200 million lives between 1347 and 1352, smallpox killed 500 million over decades, bouts of cholera outbreaks, the emergence of hiv/aids and what notthe list is huge and intimidating. but covid-19 is cut from a different cloth, exposing various loopholes and the modern worlds inability to fend off pandemics and epidemics despite advancements in science, healthcare, and technology.the covid-19 pandemic has invoked an unprecedented seismic shift across segmentsthe world economy is declining, third world countries with underdeveloped healthcare industry are spiraling into poverty and darkness (read about ecuador being trapped between death and debt), the imf declaring a global recessionits a concoction of tragedy, turmoil, and tribulations. one particularly interesting domain to mull over is the world of work, an umbrella term that encompasses industries, businesses, organizations, and all that jazz.hundreds of thousands of layoffs are happening in sectors like travel and tourism, hospitality, manufacturing, and basically every other customer-facing domain; not to mention those which rely solely or heavily on physical labor. quarantine, a measure proposed and already implemented by hundreds of nations to limit the spread of coronavirus, has stopped people from going to their workplace. offices are empty, factories are silent with machines gathering dust, hotels and restaurants are deserted, etc. the outcome has compelled organizations to remain strong in the face of this adversity and circumvent the problem of employees not being able to step out of their homes. the concept of work from home or wfh is now mainstream and the irrational ideology of decline in productivity and revenue upon implementing wfh has gone for a toss. the surge in the use of video conferencing apps attests to this. zoom, a popular video call software, has witnessed more than double the number of users in march. organizations are now cognizant of wfh and its benefits.the onslaught of normal working conditions by covid-19 has made companies revisit the concept of redundancy. it is time to re-evaluate ones workforce and underline core jobs essential to keeping the company running while highlighting the not-so-important ones. of course, to render employees jobless and terminate them at this point casts a negative light on the organizations reputation. so, companies are smart enough to ward such drastic cost-cutting measures at the momenta few that did so are under the radar of their respective governments for the wrong reasons. its not unreasonable to expect corporations to impose significant changes in workforce strength and hierarchy once economic rectitude kicks in.with passing time, more and more countries now have lockdown measures in place. confined within homes, those with jobs now see the term work-life balance unravel. the vicious cycle of workwake up, go to the office, back at home, have food, sleep, and repeat the same all over againis a hot-button topic today. the disastrous consequences of burnout at work, job-related stress and the consistent pressure to perform are at the receiving end of much-needed attention like never. often neglected aspects of life like health, family, contentment, and well-being are not taken for granted anymore. the canard that coronavirus and its virulence is restricted only to the aged has been put to rest. with fatalities in every age-group, workers now grasp the importance of neglecting health for office. once lifes back on track, a reduction in work-related burnouts and health issues is imminent.boredom and restlessness (brought about by lockdown) have compelled people to upskill themselves; the presence of mooc and online courses has buttressed e-learning/online education. linkedin is now riddled with professionals flaunting the latest certification from udemy and coursera. it took a pandemic for many employees to correlate continuous learning with success and recognition at the workplace. after a couple of months, youll find yourself surrounded by smart peers whom you didnt heed to earlier.under the pretext of pursuing long left hobbies and passions, the number of active freelancers has increased. individuals pressed by office workers are using the extra time at hand to take up freelancing and augment their primary source of income. content writers, copywriters, graphic designers, tutors are now dime a dozen. will freelancers sustain this flow once the health scare settles? we dont know. but, covid-19, without any second thoughts, has given a leg-up to the freelancer culture.working across time zones has always been a bummer. converting indian standard time to eastern time zone, central time to some other time zone, etc. for meetings meant ensuing headaches. to ensure the business continues, employees divided by geographies are now more accommodating to get cross-functional tasks done. organizations are witnessing better coordination and collaboration across teams sitting in different parts of the world.car manufacturers are developing ventilators, hundreds of tech ventures are building covid trackers, predictors, assistant chatbots and awe-inspiring apps, logistics are bending accepted ways to deal with transportationan influx of change for good lies in front of us. unimaginable innovation and creativity have risen from the depths of oblivion!the dark side of social media i.e. the use of such platforms to spread rumors and false news is has become more evident than ever. an indian it giant expelled one of its employees in lieu of his abominable facebook post to spread coronavirus. organizations will heighten vigilance of what their staff post, publish, or advocate on digital platforms. condemnable information would bring in dire consequences that extend beyond simple termination. it seems social media has taken a hit for good.all in all, the global outbreak of covid-19 has ushered in a slew of radical changes to how work is perceived in the grand scheme of things. 2020 will go down in history books as the year that shook the very fundamentals of the world of work!","['respiratory', 'illness', 'started', 'patient', 'zero', 'wuhan',

29,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/coronavirus-impact-on-the-hospitality-industry-3/,Coronavirus Effect on the Hospitality Industry | blackcoffer insights,"the hospitality sector in india has witnessed unprecedented deceleration this year in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic. the indian hotel sector has been hit hard, tussling with significantly low demand, with very few future bookings. since the outbreak of covid-19, companies have been canceling interviews at the top hotel management colleges in india. the overall hiring sentiment in the country is witnessing a negative impact in the short term with 60-65 percent of interviews getting postponed, especially in the hospitality services sector, following the slowdown across industries triggered by the coronavirus pandemic. even the students who were aspiring for a career in the hospitality industry are on the verge of full swing. currently, with the imposition of section 144, there are barely any bookings being made for the future, and the current ones all stand canceled. in this scenario, there is limited scope for quick revival.its proud to see that this sector shows its maturity level: in working together, showing their true hospitality commitments in helping out our society where they can. for example by making their venue available for hospital beds and hospital employees. the situation we are in also brings new business models and opportunities, in defining, for instance, new delivery concepts, human capital sharing platforms, initiatives in promoting the staycation or holiday concept and the use of the less productive time to work on activities that were normally pushed forward like asset counts, security plans, defining standard operating procedures, social media plans, etc.what has caused the panic?this may seem obvious, but its worth looking at this a bit closer. the main reason there was such widespread panic was that the government announced its advice to avoid public meeting places like restaurants, bars, and pubs without simultaneously announcing a complete ban or a plan to support the businesses whose revenue streams theyd just denied. many of these businesses operate on low margins and very fragile cash flow already so the prospect of survival for an indefinite period of time without income seemed very bleak indeed. this has taken a mental toll on already stressed business owners and their worried staff.facts & figures coronavirus effect on the hospitality:the impact of the novel coronavirus on indias hospitality sector jobs is nothing short of severe. while most economists expect things to rebound in the latter half of the year, uncertainty still lurks. a sheer job trauma is staring at the hospitality industry in the near future. this is as the chances of losing a job are at high risk. furthermore the entry-level has postponed the hiring for the near future. let us check here some of the facts concerning the drop in the various hotel occupancy sectors.the countrys daily hotel occupancy dropped to 11% during 23-29 march, according to preliminary data from str, department of revenue, ministry of finance, government of india due to covid-19 concerns, and limitations that have intensified in india.along with a steep downward trend in occupancy, the average daily rate (adr), and revenue per available room (revpar) have also dropped significantly in india. adr, which has dropped year over year by around 20% or more for eight consecutive days, went as low as inr4, 924.18 on 28 march. revpar attained its least absolute level (inr537.54) on 22 march.in india, both luxury and budget hotels are running at just 10 percent of occupancy levels as thousands of people have canceled their trips. this may further worsen in the times to come at least till the end of this year. for instance, airbnb announced its guests could cancel their reservations for a full refund.the overall revenue of the indian hotel sector is set to decline by anywhere between us$ 8.85 billion to us$ 10 billion, reflecting an erosion of 39% to 45% compared to last year.besides the actual business loss, the hotel owners will also incur losses due to fixed operating expenses, debt repayments, interest payments, and several other compliances required to be undertaken as part of the sector.withhospitality and travelsectors among the worst affected by covid-19, oyos entire executive leadership (cxos) team has taken a voluntary pay cut, starting at 25%, with many opting for a supplementary untapped amount, and some going up to 50% to enable constructing the runway for the company.ritesh agarwal, the founder & group ceo, oyo hotels & homes, has decided to forego 100% of his salary for the rest of the year in the wake of the novel coronavirus crisis.proposed action plans -coronavirus effect on the hospitalitythe hospitality industry can use this chasm to prepare for the upcoming demand by focusing on marketing and up-gradation. this stop gap plan is about maintaining a thread of communication, using social media and advertisements, with the consumers. its also about strengthening the communication within the company, making a budget and plan for re-opening, and utilizing this period to fix and upgrade whatever is possible. another step is where all the action is required by the sector. once the outbreak of the virus is contained and the world is set to travel again, it is suggested that any plan of re-opening must be done keeping long-term benefits and safety compliances in mind. it is imperative that hospitality companies reach out to deferred and canceled bookings and give due attention to domestic travelers. the hotels and airlines must slowly roll out their services rather than starting everything instantly and not get caught up in spending.this way coronavirus effect on the hospitalitya way forward: recommendations for the government of indiathe government is already taking measures to combat the effects of the pandemic on the country. here are the multiple measures, if taken by the government of india, can help the indian hotel industry weather the current storm.stimulus package to stabilize and support the hospitality sector in the near term, including a workforce support fund to ensure that there are no job losses.provide a moratorium of ~ 6 12 months on all loans (principal & interest), including working capital payments and overdrafts.ensure that credit rating agencies do not downgrade ratings of businesses, due to the expected volatility of the business in the short to medium term.
provide a 12-month corporate tax holiday to travel, tourism, and hospitality sectors.
defer all statutory dues such as advance tax, custom duties, excise duties, pf, bank charges, etc. at the central and state level for 12 months.
the government authorities must ensure that there is adequate availability of collateral-free and interest-free credit for organizations in the hospitality,travel, and tourismindustries. what will coronavirus leave behind? really this is anyones guess. we dont yet know how long it will take for the epidemic to peak and for us to be allowed out again, but one thing i am sure of is that well all be desperate to meet up with friends over dinner or have a pint in the pub! with proper support from the government i think the hospitality industry stands a good chance of bouncing back quickly, but perhaps not in its former form. it is likely that we will see a kind of natural selection take place among restaurants, leaving space for innovative new entrants. the crisis has already forced several restaurants to innovate by developing new services and perhaps, if regulation allows, these will stick, becoming new models for restaurants in the future and offering them a more diverse and resilient set of revenue streams. thus coronavirus effect on the hospitality and other sectors.

pandemic, covid-19these are just a few terms that come to mind when you wake up every morning and listen to the world mourning. with the coronavirus pandemic hitting almost 210 countries throughout the globe and having no possible cure for the foreseeable future, the state of the world is as dismal as it can ever get. the great lockdown as it is being called is having adverse effects on almost everything a common man does but more importantly having a grave impact on the world of work. in this article, lets look at what is the current status of the working population throughout the world and what lies ahead in the future.2020 marked the beginning of a new decade and a seemingly difficult one for various organizations across the world. the first quarter of 2020 brought with it, major issues for the workforce. the implementation of lockdowns in various countries such as india, germany, italy, china, the uk, etc. has made work from home a compulsion for everyone except those working for essential goods and services companies. the crisis has already led to a worldwide economic slowdown and a period of recession is looming on our heads. the international monetary fund (imf) has predicted a shrink of 3% in the global gdp indicating the extent of the crisis. the severity of the issue is being felt by various big companies in india and other major powers of the world. in an interview, anand mahindra, ceo of m&m group said that the manufacturing and production sector has been hit the hardest with the lack of labor force. he mentioned the lack of wage workers who help in loading and unloading of material is making transport a major issue for his company, also hinting at the importance of these small workers on the macro-level. ceos and managers of various organizations are having a hard time dealing with this crisis. with almost all mncs such as pwc, bcg, deloitte, ibm, infosys, etc. making work from home compulsory till around mid-may20, the importance of technology is at its peak now. whether its conducting meetings over zoom or conference calls over duo, staying at home and working is becoming normal as we move forward. service-based companies are finding it easier to complete their tasks as compared to product-based companies. according to the imf the world is going to lose usd 9 trillion in output in 2020 which is more than the combined output of both germany and japan.the manufacturing sector is one of the worst-hit by the pandemic. china, the worlds largest exporter of goods and the epicenter of the covid-19 pandemic has seen a significant fall in output in the first two months of 2020. chinese industrial production has fallen by 13.5% and major manufacturers in china are facing problems relating to the shutdown and lack of workforce. restrictions have affected the supply of chinese companies like jcb, saic, nissan to name a few. organizations such as samsung, kia, hyundai, and all other non-essential goods companies have been forced to shut down factories to comply with lockdown norms and for the safety of their employees. indian manufacturing giants such as bajaj and tata have taken the toll due to the lockdown measures in india. bajaj has been forced to cut employee salaries by 30% and worker salaries by 10% due to a lack of revenue. us-based smartphone and tech giant apple inc. has shut all its stores worldwide with its factories in china and the usa unable to produce new products for the time being. these are just a few examples and production has been hit globally in all countries and there is a lack of demand to compliment this, further enhancing the problem faced by producers.the world of work also includes those who are willing and able to work but cannot find a job, i.e., the unemployed. the unemployment rate is at a staggering high across all nations affected by the pandemic. according to the us bureau of labor statistics, the number of people filing for unemployment hit a record high close to 7 million people. china reported an unemployment rate of 6.2% in jan20 and figures are expected to get worse in many other countries. according to the international labor organization, more than 25 million workers may go jobless soon due to this crisis and lead to a significant decline in income. the financial crisis of 2008 caused a 22 million spike in unemployment worldwide and the nature of the current situation makes it more dangerous. the fall in revenues and effects on both supply as well as demand mean that companies are having a hard time maintaining their balance sheet and taking care of their liabilities. lack of job opportunities from the next quarter and salary cuts for existing employees might be the way forward in the corporate world.amongst all the negative impacts of covid-19 on organizations across the globe, there are a few opportunities that are ready to be explored after this crisis. technology and artificial intelligence are key aspects that have been mentioned in the past to be the ones contributing to the growth and a rise in revenues for various businesses. in times of social distancing and a shutdown of physical services, the digital markets may prove to be game-changers in the near future. offering products online and promoting through digital marketing will be at the forefront. the quarantine time must be utilized in order to improve existing products and increase the customer base of companies. byjus, indias famous online learning platform is leading by example in this front by offering its application essentials and courses for free. this will help them expand their brand in the coming years and create a customer base. cult fit, a bangalore based fitness startup has used technology to create an application helping fitness freaks to workout from home. oneplus, the chinese smartphone brand launched its new flagship, the oneplus 8 in an online event, and created a filter to let smartphone lovers do a virtual unboxing of the device as getting the device physically is not possible at the moment due to restrictions. decathlon, americas leading sports and fitness equipment brand started an online campaign, were in this together and the hashtag to appeal to their customers and increase sales of their home workout equipment. these examples show how brands and organizations have realized the importance of this lockdown to expand their base and consolidate their position in the market as they battle out the crisis.the covid-19 pandemic has led to chaos and panic throughout the working world. but there are huge opportunities for companies to expand and improve in the future. all organizations need to have a designed plan in place to ensure smooth functioning once the lockdown is lifted. social distancing and hygiene will become key for manufacturing industries. the travel industry which is currently in its worst state will need to recover fast in order to ensure the safe movement of passengers once borders are reopened across the world. the service sector will need to move to digital platforms and hype digital marketing. artificial intelligence will play a key role with a reduction in workforce eminent due to lack of demand. handling tasks with the help of ai and reducing the need for an employee will improve cost-effectiveness until revenues rise back to normal. e-learning has evolved over the past few years and its importance has been realized over this quarantine period. all major colleges and schools have transformed into an online program in order to educate students. this change is likely to be carried forward with more and more educational institutes switching platforms. e-commerce has also been an integral part of the world and will become even more important in the coming days. as malls and markets are shut and are expected to remain shut, e-commerce websites will benefit from the same. it is also an opportunity for retailers and vendors to create their base online or sell through e-retailers in order to generate revenue. small vendors and retailers will continue to be an important part of the supply of the essential good to households and improving sanitation in these places will be key. mncs that have switched to the atmosphere of work from home will find it easier to connect large groups of people together at all times and ensure all employees contribute to the smooth functioning of the companies in the crucial days up ahead. entrepreneurial minds will also be encouraged to put forth their idea and create a startup of their own to make the corporate world an improved space in the future.the world is in a state of panic and it is important for all of us to be united in this fight against covid-19. as employees continue to work from home and make study rooms their cabins, organizations need to adapt to this new style of working and realize its importance for the coming months until a solution is found for this problem. internet and online services will play an important role in the future. this transition will lead to a better digital world and improve accessibility throughout the globe.stay safe, stay together and develop your company further!

31,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/covid-19-how-have-countries-been-responding-2/,COVID-19: How have countries been responding? - Blackcoffer Insights,"if anything kills over 10 million people over the next few decades, its most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war bill gatesbill gates in his tedx address in 2015 pointed out to the predicament of world leaders who failed to invest sufficiently into health infrastructure and he further elaborated on the inability of the prevailing health facilities to accommodate the next pandemic the world would face.the whole world is grappling with covid-19- the virus that took birth in the city of wuhan and spread across the globe, claiming more than half a hundred thousand lives and affecting more than two million people.with the fear of the virus spreading, the whole world entered into a complete and stringent lockdown mandated by the national governments. this caused economic activities worldwide to come to a standstill except for sectors that provisioned essential goods and services. the international agency-imf has projected that the global output will contract by 3% in 2020 which is even worse than the 2008-09 financial crises. moody downgraded the global growth forecast to 2.5% in 2020 from an earlier estimate of 5.3%. the us economy is expected to contract by 2%, euro-era by 2.2% and china is expected to grow at 3.3% rather than an earlier estimate of 6% in 2021the national governments have been presented with inevitable challenges of ensuring sustenance and livelihood to masses, improving investor confidence and preventing the economies from falling into a recession in the absence of consumerism amidst the uncertainty about the longevity and future intensity of the pandemic.the goi took the decision to enter into lockdown in the preliminary phase of the spread of the virus. the indian economy in the fiscal year 2019 was already hit by severe npa crises. it witnessed a downward spiral and grew at a mere rate of 5% as against 6.8 % in 2018 as per the statistics released by the nso-national statistical organization. the manufacturing and construction sectors were negative outliers. the government in order to recuperate announced a plethora of decisions. the government cut the corporate tax from 30% to 22% and for manufacturing enterprises from 25% to 15%. in order to strengthen the position of public sector banks, the government announced the merger of 10 public sector banks into 4the government also announced a fiscal stimulus of 1.7 lakh crores inr stepping over its fiscal deficit target in order to drive the economy out of the downward spiral and get it on the path of growth, giving lubricant to an economy facing liquidity crunch with heightening npa.but the coronavirus outbreak halted the economic activity and posed government the issue of fulfilling the basic survival needs of workers in the informal sector in the wake of massive urbanization. the daily wage earners tried to walk down to their native places in huge numbers posing immense difficulty for the government.apart from that the domestic equity market indices- the bse sensex and nse nifty crashed which reflected the erosion of investor confidence and reflected stealth of bearish sentiment around the world.all this amalgamated together posed a serious question on the survival of a huge chunk of the indian population and invited a lot of criticism for the government.this is when the central nda government announced a fiscal relief package: the central government announced a fiscal stimulus of additional inr 1.7 lakh crores that constitutes approximately 0.8% of indias gdp under pradhan mantri gareeb kalyan yojna. this fiscal stimulus is used to target the underprivileged section of the society instead of conventional indirectly lubricating the economy through deficit financing.the government under the nfsa-national food security act has decided to provide an additional 5 kg of indian staple wheat and rice and 1 kg of pulses every month to people with ration cards. the government is expanding and accelerating the dissemination of unilateral transfers under various government schemes. under pm kisan scheme an indian farmer receives payment of inr 6000 in three installments every year. out of 6000 the goi had disbursed inr 2000 immediately. the government has made a provision of providing 2 installments inr 1000 for the next three months those already availing old ages, women, or disability pension. the women who are jan dhan account holders are to receive inr 500 for the next three months. the government assured the availability of cooking gas by providing 1 lpg cylinder for the next three months to 8.3 crores people covered under ujjwal yojna. the government in order to prevent the deterioration of and encourage entrepreneurial spirit in already discriminated rural women the government made a provision for women shgs where they can receive collateral-free loans up to inr 20 lakhs under nrlm (national rural livelihood mission). the government also enhanced payment under mgnrega from inr 180/day to inr 202/day.the government has also taken upon itself to provide for the epf contributions of 12% each of the basic salaries of both employees and employers for the next three months. in order to ensure household liquidity the employees can withdraw from their epf accounts balance up to 75%. the goi is also providing insurance coverage if inr 50 lakh for a tenure of 3 months for about 22 lakh health workers in government hospitals inclusive of asha workers, medical, sanitary workers, and paramedics.the finance minister nirmala sitaraman also pointed out that increased money supply combined with the dollar swap with the usa will help curb the inflammatory effect also.shaktikanta das, the rbi chief announced a monetary relief package for the economy that seemed to regain investor confidence as the national stock indices rallied. the following are the elements of the package:the repo rate is the rate at which the commercial banks can avail loans from rbi. the rbi cut repo rate by 75 basis points from 5.15% to 4.4%. this reduction in the cost of borrowing from rbi gives commercial banks an incentive to enjoy increased margins by borrowing at a relatively lower rate than past and investing at the same rate i.e. by granting loans to businesses and households.cut in reverse-repo rate by 25 basis points from 4% to 3.5%. the reverse repo rate is the rate at which banks can park their funds with the rbi. this primarily implies the reduction in the interest rate the banks can earn by parking their funds with the rbi. this incentivizes them to lend. but given the commercial banks acquaintance with the friction caused by erosion of consumerism due to fear of covid-19; it is hard to forecast how successful the aforementioned steps are.the rbi also announced a moratorium or a provision to defer payments of emis on home, car, and credit card dues for a period of 3 months from 1st march-31st may. the government also provided for interest-free loans for the msme sector to meet their working capital requirements after the lockdown has been uplifted.the rbi also announced a refinancing window for inr 50,000 crores for financial institutions like nabard, national housing bank, and sidbi.as the markets crashed the foreign institutional investors withdrew their investments from the indian market, increasing the demand for usd and increasing the supply of inr causing the rupee to depreciate. the currency hit the bottom low of inr 76/ usd. to prevent further erosion in the value of rupee the rbi entered into a 6-month swap agreement with the us government. the deliberation to undertake a currency swap began when as a result of panic-selling the foreign exchange reserves fell around $7.5 billion in two weeks to $439.66 billion on march 27.despite tourism, hospitality, domestic trade, airline industry taking a hit, india was presented with quite a few opportunities as well.india came as a messiah to export hydroxychloroquine to the usa, followed by indian pharmacy companies- lupin, dr. reddys laboratories, strides pharmas plants in india, and biocons plant in malaysia being given clearance by us fda-us food and drug administration. this gives massive export opportunities to these entities, improving their growth prospectus. the crash of crude oil prices caused by falling out of negotiations between opec and russia creating supply pressure along with lowered demand enabled india to lower its import bill. according to a report by icra every $10 decline in crude oil price saved india $15 billion.not only india but countries like the usa, japan, uk, and germany have announced massive fiscal stimulus packages to equip their economies to come out of this phase of decelerating economic activity.us announced a fiscal package of $2 trillion with is approximately 9.3% of its gdp. this relief package is the largest relative to the gdp is the largest of the kind in the modern american history. it is way larger than $800 billion assistance provided in 2008. germany introduced largest fiscal stimulus in relation to gdp.the following graph indicates the fiscal stimulus as a proportion of gdp of respective countriesworkers in the us whose annual incomes are up to $75000 will receive $1200 in direct payments as well as $500 for every offspring. america being america came to the rescue of businesses by allocating $500 billion to businesses and local government bodies.it announced various sectorial packages-$50 billion for passenger airlines, $8 billion for cargo carriers, $17 billion for businesses involved in maintaining national security. taking care of the small industry sector, the us government committed itself to devote $350 billion to the working capital requirements of these entities. the government further allocated $150 billion for the health care sector, $45 billion for the disaster relief fund, $31 billion for the education sector, $27 billion for research and development, and $15.5 billion towards the food stamp program.. republican president donald trump has been under a lot of criticism lately. the tackling of the covid-19 crises by america could either relinquish trump administration or them another tenure. but so far the situation seems critical with the usa registered with the maximum number of caseschina- the epicenter of the pandemic has been facing a lot of backlash from world powers like the usa, uk, france, and germany; each country asking for monetary compensation. the us even alleged that china has conducted low-frequency nuclear tests while the whole world is anguished. china has also been frowned upon for acquiring a stake in various companies like-the pboc enhancing its claim in hdfc to 1% and many other entities amidst panic selling. china also capitalized on low crude oil prices by creating massive buffers. it further exported ppe to various countries, capitalizing on the minutest of opportunities available.this is the time to be prudent and try to remain optimistic as is illuminated by charlie munger,-i would when the worst typhoon thats ever happened comes. we just want to get through typhoon and wed rather come out it with a whole lot of liquidity. blackcoffer

emotional to social, philosophy to physical. economical to the thread of lifeit is known as present as part of life. which tell as on a daily base to the world just stop your self where you are present..if you move you will lose to yourself and to others, its like a story which tells which we listen in our childhood one dirty fish harm the all see.so now we have one only options to not move which tell as that we cant work as we working 3months earlier.till the hope of living make new invention to challenge the world biggest challengeupto that time we have stop to as to work as we are working eailer that mean we have to do essential workthis self defince throory and sanjvini of life is going to affect world of work as i mantion in many why before we understand current sanrioi wold like to share some personal life experiences with you i belong to small beautiful city it far from 250 km from india capital new delhistory of today my city is not that mctah complex as big metro city or world most developed nations are facings problem of covid but still we are at self isolated face as city ti safe as here the problem which tell as beautiful stories 4week earlier when there no lock down was there our maid came to work at home and my mom asked here to stop working she repided very beautiful that if we stop working who will going to take care of my family. here directly saying moany is one thing at that time but may mon replied here that we will help you and i also replied here that government will also help if their situation will be critical but she reply again and told me that what use of here good health that if we cant use to for work and she continues to come on work till 2day of 1st lockdown. she stops till when law forced here to stop heremy mom asked here yesterday when she comes to our medical shop to take medicine for her family. what you are doing know days she replied again in a beautiful way and told us that she said i going into gurdwara to for making food for a needed person with taking some sought of privation i asked why you are doing she replied that i am financial strong so that i can help other but i can do which i can do is work for otherthis story give many views regarding the current working scenario. even i was thinking earlier we are going fave of life where we going to so lazy and more addicted of device yes we going to attend of these things but as our dna and value system and living force to earn money for living or living for money is going to work as past this story till me that we going to past as future today is just phase which will pass out one day with some spreading difficulty and learning of life that give a clear picture that we not going to time world work stop in future and if we talk about the current scenario we still not our critical work yes we have to stop or we many cases we stop using unnecessary think. let discuss the current world work situation with some facts and figures..in the worst-case scenario, the world economy could contract by 0.9 percent in 2020, the desa said, adding that the world economy had contracted by 1.7 percent during the global financial crisis in 2009. this will result in a massive increase in the unemployment rate even some figure start to come regarding jobless like:america till know project that they are going to be 2 crore jobless due to covid19 if this will continue till 3 moth more, see face developing nation when the name of doping nation come to the first ma,e come into mind is indiawith reference of business stand article;we estimated the cost of lockdown nearly 17.008 lakh crore or rupee 17 trillion dollar loss to a different sector of business if strictly lockdown is followed till 17 may lets see sector waysthe mining sector is going to affect completely with the loss of 0.6975 lakh crore rupees only and manufacturing sector going face loss of 4.86 lakh crore only, construction cooling shut down for 2.385 lakh crore loss, trade hotel transport business and broadcasting facing loss 5.445 lakh crore, financial real estate are going face loss of6.3225 lakh crore which make total 17 lakh crore lossthis finger is eagle to the total focal budget of the movement of india of 2015 and india estimate covid 19 costs the 3 crore people jobless in india so imagine where we are going but still, we have hope to get well soon because we know when to work or when to stop us. my last opinion state work of word today affected but after some time we will at the same path where we in the past it just need some afford.","['covid', 'affect', 'world', 'every', 'way', 'life', 'emotional', 'social', 'philosophy', 'physical', 'economical', 'thread', 'lifeit', 'known', 'present', 'part', 'life', 'tell', 'daily',

33,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/lessons-from-the-past-some-key-learnings-relevant-to-the-coronavirus-crisis-2/,Lessons from the past: Some key learnings relevant to the coronavirus crisis - Blackcoffer Insights,"the more you know about the past, the better prepared you are for the future.theodore rooseveltas we speak, the world finds itself engulfed in one of its worst crises in recent times. the global covid-19 pandemic has caused never-seen-before disruption in both public and economic life. not only have factories shut down or supply chains abruptly stopped or millions of workers stranded, but festivals suspended, families separated across countries and public-healthcare systems put under tremendous stress. such a scenario is a first-time for many, but the world has been through pandemics of a similar scale and nature before, and after the due struggle, emerged victoriously. as the more experienced amongst us would remember, the sars and mers outbreaks in the early 2000s presented a similar scenario, although at a much lower rate of infection, yet with higher rates of morbidity. going back further in time, the 1918 spanish flu brought a world just out of the first world war, to a standstill. considered to be the worst amongst modern-era pandemics, the influenza pandemic affected one-third of the worlds population and 50 million lives. yet, preventive measures such as social-distancing, quarantine, mass-vaccinations, public support, and restraint have proved to be successful in all such situations, even being effective in occasional plague outbreaks across the world. we face a similar situation today an extremely infectious virus, which has already spread globally, confined people to their homes and is causing tremendous economic loss every minute economic activity remains suspended, affecting both the government and the industries alike.can past similar incidents guide industries in such trying times? can our governments take note of how public-policy measures adopted during the spanish flu, sars and mers outbreak helped in eliminating such pandemics?what can the government learn?the panic due to the outbreak of covid-19, and more importantly, the lockdown measures to deal with it, are quite similar to those during the 1918 influenza pandemic, or as it is more commonly referred to as, the spanish flu. large cities around the world were put under strict lockdowns, and businesses worldwide came to a grinding halt as large chunks of the population became bedridden.the immediate consequences were the same as the ones observed in the past few weeks rampant unemployment, supply shortages, and heavy reliance on social security systems, causing a sudden strain on national economic resources.impact & learningsinformation & censorshipeffective and transparent communications are one of the most crucial and useful tools in disease control. iran presents a great example of the damage that can be unleashed by a media-blackout. secondly, censorship might not be the best way to appease the masses during such times. the long-term political impact of media censorship and manipulation of epidemic-related facts in china is yet to be seen. still, the short-term international unrest and dissent have only deteriorated international relations. at the risk of quoting a clich as well as the established streisand effect, the truth always comes out, no matter how many countries try to hide it.isolation, lockdown & distancing mechanisms workthe spanish flu spread was aggravated due to the failure of policymakers in adopting effective containment measures. research shows that us cities which undertook measures to reduce contact amongst citizens in early-1918 displayed significantly lower peak death rates compared to cities that failed to or were too late to adopt disease containment policies.to quote the results from this 2007 study, consistent with this hypothesis, cities in which multiple interventions were implemented at an early phase of the epidemic had peak death rates 50% lower than those that did not and had less-steep epidemic curves. they also displayed lower cumulative mortality. 1: contrasting the death rates in philadelphia v. st. louis during the 1918 influenza outbreak1: contrasting the death rates in philadelphia v. st. louis during the 1918 influenza outbreakas one might guess, philadelphia was late to levy restrictions on gatherings, parades, and social distancing measures, whereas st. louis was not.from the same study, we see the definition of a popular phrase flattening the curve emerging which is spreading out the rate of infection over time, enabling health care systems to treat people in a staggered manner, in line with available resources. and, to further corroborate this result, the following graph from the same study shows the different trajectories followed by the disease in two cities of the us.hence, regardless of the multiple debunking claims of social-distancing & lockdown as an effective preventive mechanism, previous epidemics have taught us that they perform a marvelous job at flattening the curve.premature relaxation can be disastroussocial distancing & lockdown measures are effective, only if sustained, at least for a few months, even after things start to improve.markel (2007), shows the disastrous consequences that the early relaxation of bans on public gatherings in st. louis had on death rates, during the spanish flu. the pullback of social distancing measures to pursue economic interests was premature and caused a sudden, unprecedented surge in the number of deaths due to the flu. 2: deaths due to the spanish flu in st. louis a wider picture. the black & grey lines show the duration for which social-distancing measures were active.2: deaths due to the spanish flu in st. louis a wider picture. the black & grey lines show the duration for which social-distancing measures were active.another peak in death rates was observed only in cities that had relaxed distancing measures prematurely. hence, it is crucial to consider this past artifact when governments compare the inconveniences to the public & damage caused to the economy due to such measures, with the benefits to the nation in terms of human life saved, and then make the call as to when the restrictions must be eased.what can the industry learn?the industry has played a key role in the obscure fight against the worldwide outbreak. but it faces its fair share of challenges, in such unprecedented times.supply shortages, due to shut-down of factories & production houses and the uncertainty of when production systems would resume to normal functioning.transport disruptions, due to closure & quarantining of cities and state-borders; nation-wide lockdowns bringing all transportation to a standstill; significant disruptions in the supply-chains of most goods.labour issues, with restrictions on movement, come issues of labour welfare, unrest and employment security. this problem is even more serious if the labour force is migratory in nature.global industries have weathered through multiple natural disasters and two epidemics of a similar scale and nature. their recovery-paths have immense strategic implications for current policy-makers and offer strategic insights, helping companies chart out their short-term & long-term strategies.3: this graph looks at the retail sales impact of the sars epidemic in china in 2003; the earthquake, tsunami and fukushima nuclear disaster in japan in 2011; and the mers epidemic in south korea in 201.53: this graph looks at the retail sales impact of the sars epidemic in china in 2003; the earthquake, tsunami and fukushima nuclear disaster in japan in 2011; and the mers epidemic in south korea in 201.5three phases characterise the impact on the retail market in all these three cases:shockrecoverystabilizationthe paths inevitably converge to stabilization but follow different trajectories, and are swayed by public perceptions and externalities, as in the case of the mid-autumn festival in south korea. looking at the retail sector from a micro-lens, past crises show that demand trends vary amongst product categories, both during and post the crisis. the three categories usually follow such trends:demand trends during & post a pandemic-generated crisis4: demand trends during & post a pandemic-generated crisis4: demand trends during & post a pandemic-generated crisis[1]these three trends are a valuable tool for both large scale players and regional retailers who now have the means to prioritize and predict consumer-demand and consequently alleviate a sudden strain on the product supply chain arising out of sudden & unexpected demands.change in consumer behavioura peculiar outcome of such epidemics have been the somewhat permanent changes instilled in consumer buying trends across the inflicted regions, across product categories fresh staples see a sharp rise in their demand and product hygiene & safety standards are ranked higher up in the consumers priority list. hence, the advantage lies with producers who can quickly integrate changed consumer-preferences in their products, showcase product reliability & quality, and priced competitively, given the prevalent context. lastly, previous pandemics have consolidated a long-standing theory, which is true not just for the retail sector but for any consumer-centric industry that there is, consumer loyalty is tried and tested during these times. effective consumer relationship management (crm) can forge bonds that go a long way, weathering through the thick and thin in such unprecedented times.implicationsalmost two decades ago, the sars outbreak in china had pushed entrepreneurs and established players to embrace the dawn of the e-commerce era. this outbreak is expected to accelerate further the shift from conventional brick-mortar based commerce to a centralized online cloud-store based mechanism. survival, in the fmcg sector at least, will be decided to a great extent by the breadth of the supply chain networks and the ability to overcome severe bottlenecks.the past has shown that even though established large-scale players with deep pockets and extensive networks, have a likelier chance to tough it through these hard times, even the regional players & smes make it through, strengthened by community-support, empathy and most importantly, local relationships.what did we fail to learn?this global pandemic outbreak has made one thing painfully clear there is a lack of global collaborative research on ways to combat the spread of such infectious diseases. in the words of johan neyts, professor of virology and president of the belgian-based, international society for antiviral research (isar), health authorities failed to incorporate the learnings of the sars outbreak of the early 2000s, partly because of the economic crisis of 2008 which squeezed funds from any potential research that could have been undertaken and partly because of the lack of seriousness in authorities in considering the efforts involved in dealing with the future expected breaks of coronavirus due to its seven different strains in existence.the way forward?all of these lessons come with a caveat things change with time. the modes of communication have changed. both information & travel is much more accessible now. we have fast planes & faster internet. we have better healthcare capabilities and a much better, if not perfect, healthcare system. in 1918, people didnt even know that a virus was causing the pandemic until much after its eradication. today, we already have extensive research going on for 70 different probable vaccines for the virus, with a record setting pace in clinical trials and approvals.we are much better equipped than what we were 100 years ago, and at the same time, somewhat under-equipped to deal with it. but these lessons from the various similar crises that humanity has faced and risen from, act as a glimmer of hope in these dire times, and if put to good use, can aid in the fight against covid-19. in the words of howard markel, theres never been a better time in human history to have a pandemic than today, with the exception of next week or a month later. you want to kick that can down the road, but its here today.","['know', 'past', 'better', 'prepared', 'future', 'theodore', 'rooseveltas', 'speak', 'world', 'find', 'engulfed', 'one', 'worst', 'crisis',

Blackcoffer Insights,"the current topic that is burning the world alive is the deadly coronavirus. let us first understand what this coronavirus actually is. according to the world health organization (who), the coronavirus disease which is called the covid-19 is an infectious disease which is caused by the newly discovered coronavirus. the covid-19 virus is a virus that affects different people of the world in different ways. the covid-19 disease is a respiratory disease and most of the infected people will develop mild to moderate symptoms and recover without even requiring special treatment. the people who already have underlying medical conditions and those people who are over 60 years old have a higher risk of developing severe disease and death.common symptoms include:fevertirednessdry cough.other symptoms include:shortness of breathaches and painssore throatand very few people in the world will report diarrhea, nausea, or a runny nose.the people living in this world who have only mild symptoms of this deadly disease but are otherwise healthy should self-isolate and contact their medical provider or a covid-19 information line for advice on testing and referral. the people who have a fever, cough, or difficulty breathing should call their doctor and seek medical attention.some key lessons from the deadly disease coronavirus: in the last 3 months, there has been a drastic change to human life all around the world. the coronavirus outbreak happening in the world is no more just an epidemic but it is also considered as a global pandemic now. the people everywhere in the world are being asked to stay home and stay away from other people so as to reduce the risk of infection.the deadly disease coronavirus has brought with it a wave of negative outcomes, terrible illness, and death, but at the same time it has also highlighted some important life lessons. some of them are as follows:1. you should be willing to trade some of your freedom for the greater good of the public: there is no doubt for anyone that it has been difficult for everyone in the world to stay at home. many people complaining about feeling bored and aimless. some people may even have the feeling that it is a breach of their individual rights, being made to stay home. however, when it comes to the greater good, one should always be willing to sacrifice a little bit of that freedom. a balance between individual rights and public safety is an ever-changing thing. trade a little bit of your freedom for the greater good of the public.2. you should wash your hands, whether theres a virus or not: general hygiene is always important. not just when there is a virus. you should know the drill by now. wet your hands. lather them with soap. scrub for 20 seconds. rinse off. dry with a clean towel. washing hands on a regular basis are really the best way to keep safe because soap is a very effective way to kill viruses.3. working from home should be an option for many: in this time of the global outbreak of the coronavirus disease, many people have learned that their jobs were possible to do from home. most jobs have a certain amount of work that can be done remotely. without the virus in place, there should still be some system in place that will promote work-life balance.4. taking that sick day from the work could save lives: if you are feeling sick at any day in this situation, it is highly beneficial that you just stay home. it is a common feeling among lots of people that their office environment does not encourage taking sick days. many people want to appear like martyrs to their managers. this mentality needs to stop. if you are sick, just stay home.5. the internet should be a basic right: according to a study done by the university of birmingham, the right to internet access, also known as the right to broadband, should be considered a human right. many people from all over the world are unable to get online, particularly the people who live in developing countries, and so they lack meaningful ways to influence the global players shaping their everyday lives. in addition to this, during times like these, it is especially important to be able to contact family, friends, and work from home if necessary. the internet is the only way to do so.6. the doctors and the researchers need to be paid better: if this scary time has taught us anything, its that doctors and researchers will be the ones who get us out of this mess. the doctors and the researchers are the only ones who are working day and night to drive the recovery of the world. at the moment, hundreds of scientists scramble to find a coronavirus treatment. it is high time for us that we need to re-evaluate how much money hollywood actors, pro-athletes, and politicians make and instead pay the scientist and the doctors the salary they deserve.7. everyone should know how to cook: the situation that has forced everyone to stay at home has forced many people to learn, re-learn, or re-ignite their love for cooking. learning how to cook is to have one of the most important skills in life. you depend on yourself. it teaches you self-sustainability and you save a lot of money. these days, hundreds of people sharing social media posts of their delicious meals. they are re-discovering the wonders of eating in.8. the importance of talking to friends every day: now that we cant go out and keep busy, the best way to combat loneliness is to be in regular contact with friends and family, by chatting over the phone or video chatting. this is the time to have long talks and deep conversations. dont forget human connection during these crucial times. call your grandma!9. learn to appreciate nature: if you live near a spacious outdoor area, like the desert or an empty road lined with trees and you realize it is the only safe, surface-less space to take a walk in, then you start to realize how beautiful nature actually is. the point is not to remain indoors, but to avoid being in close contact with others. when you do leave your home, whether it is for a walk in the desert or a run on your street, make sure to wipe down any surfaces with which you come into contact and at the same time also avoid touching your face and frequently wash your hands.10. learn how to be content alone: it is so hard for some people to just be still and do nothing. being alone, especially for extroverts can be exhausting and lonely. social distancing can be very difficult, but it can also teach you a lot about yourself. you learn how to keep yourself busy. your body and mind is your home and you have to learn how to love it and live with it.conclusion: it is rightly said that it is important to learn from the past. the deadly coronavirus disease that is taking the lives of so many people across the world, has taught so many life lessons to the people living in it. these lessons are not meant to be forgotten but are to be remembered by human beings in order to make the earth a beautiful place to live in. lastly, i would like to conclude by mentioning that stay at home. stay safe. save lives.blackcoffer insights 17: snehasishghosh, darrang college

36,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/why-scams-like-nirav-modi-happen-with-indian-banks/,Why scams like Nirav Modi Happen with Indian banks?,"india has been beset by financial scams since independence. every 4-5 years, indian citizens hear about so many trillions of public money being misappropriated and eventually lost by people who the public is supposed to start. in this article, with examples, i would like to point out that there are two factors to scams like nirav modi: the complicity of actors within the financial industry and the systemic loopholes in an emerging financial system that has been used for scams like nirav modi.the first financial scam of independent india was found in 1958 when feroze gandhi, mp found that in 1957, haridas mundhra got the government-owned life insurance corporation (lic) to invest rs. 12.4 million (about us$3.2 million at the time) in the shares of six troubled companies of whom mundhra held a large number of shares which he was trying to boost by rigging the market. the investment was done under governmental pressure and bypassed the lics investment committee, which was informed of this decision only after the deal had gone through. in the event, lic lost most of the money. several leading stockbrokers who were on the lic investment committee testified that the investment could not have been made for the purpose of propping up the market, as was claimed by the finance ministry, and that had the lic consulted the investment committee, they would have pointed out mundhras forged shares episode from 1956. the finance minister t. t. krishnamachari, in his testimony, tried to distance himself from the lic decision, implying that it may have been taken by the finance secretary, but justice m.c. chagla held that the minister is constitutionally responsible for the action taken by his secretary and he disowns his actions. eventually, krishanamachari had to resign. the nehru government suffered considerable loss of prestige in the incident.the 1992 indian stock market scam was a stock market scam orchestrated by harshad mehta. the scam took place in mumbai and was the biggest market scam of india. the 1992 scam was a systematic stock fraud using bank receipts and stamp paper which caused the indian stock market to crash. the scam lead to a complete structural change of the security system of india and introduced a completely new system of stock transactions. the 1992 scam exposed the indian financial systems through the inherent loopholes of the system. this scam led to the reform of the security system of india and introduced online security systems. the scam was orchestrated in such a way that mehta secured securities from the state bank of india against forged cheques signed by corrupt officials and failed to deliver the securities. mehta made the prices of the stocks soar high through fictitious practices and would go on to sell the stocks that he owned in these companies. the 1992 scam raises many questions which involved many bank officials responsible for collusion with mehta. the 1992 scam caused an investigation through which many officials were implicated in fraudulent charges. the security system of india took a rapid reform in its fundamental structure post the 1992 scam. the first major structural change was the formation of the national stock exchange of india (nse). the first major reform in the financial sector of india was the formation of the cii code for desirable corporate governance developed by rahul bajaj. post-1992, a new regulatory board known as the securities and exchange board of india was formed to monitor the national stock exchange and the national securities depository. there were structural changes in the equity market. the government introduced ten acts of parliament and one constitutional amendment based upon the principles of economic reform and legislative change for the equity market. the nse introduced online trading in 1994 which changed the dynamics of stock buying and selling. the capital market now opened up nationally as opposed to being confined in mumbai. the exchange system started functioning based on satellite communications that abolished geographical barriers.in 2001, ketan parekh purchased large stakes in less known small market capitalization companies and jacked up their prices through circular trading with other traders, and collusion with these companies and large institutional investors. this resulted in steep hikes in share prices. it later transpired that promoters and industrialists often gave parekh funds to artificially rig up their share prices. this set of ten stocks was colloquially referred to as k-10 stocks and parekh was playfully referred to as pentafour. the rbi commenced an investigation against parekh. around the same time, a bear cartel of brokers in mumbai opposed to parekh tried to dump their shares of k-10 stocks. panicking, parekh sold off his entire ownership of the so-called k-10 stocks that he had successfully jacked up over the past two years. this resulted in a stock market crash the next day, resulting in large-scale losses for large institutional investors, including insurance companies and mutual funds. a 30 member joint parliamentary committee (jpc) investigation ensued which found that parekh had been involved in circular trading throughout the time period from and with a variety of companies.when the securities exchange board of india (sebi) started scanning an entire spectrum of ipos launched over 2003, 2004, and 2005, it ended digging up more dirt and probably prevented a larger conspiracy to hijack the market. it involved the manipulation of the primary marketread initial public offers (ipos)by financiers and market players by using fictitious or benaami demat accounts. they then transferred the shares to financiers, who sold on the first day of listing, making windfall gains from the price difference between the ipo price and the listing price. this time, fraudsters targeted the primary market to make a quick buck at the expense of the gullible small investors. direct participants (dps) used retail applicants shares for reaping benefits in the stock market.the 2010 fake housing loan in india was uncovered by the central bureau of investigation (cbi) in india. cbi arrested eight top-ranking officials of public sector banks and financial institutions, including the lic housing finance ceo ramchandran nair, in connection with the scam. cbi alleged that the officers of various public sector banks and financial institutions received bribes from a private financial services company, which acted as a mediator for corporate loans and other facilities from financial institutions. the bank officials sanctioned large-scale corporate loans to realty developers, overriding mandatory conditions for such approvals along with other irregularities.the thane police, struggling to crack down on the tax refund scam that has taken the income tax department for a ride and defrauded the central exchequer of around rs 3 crore, has concluded that the scam involved high-ranking officials from the i-t department and the state bank of india. the fraud-involving two i-t offices in thane and kalyan was planned by those familiar with the i-t office functioning. for over two years, 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, the i-t officials disbursed tax refund cheques drawn from the sbi and credited into the account of fictitious assessees in a credit society in dombivli. as many as 331 such tax refund cheques, some exceeding rs 1 lakh, were subsequently routed to the dombivli nagri cooperative bank and funds withdrawn. the i-t refunds are account payee cheques, which cant be transferred. despite this, all 331 refund orders were credited to the third-party account of a credit society.the saradha group financial scandal was a major financial scam and alleged political scandal caused by the collapse of a ponzi scheme run by saradha group, a consortium of over 200 private companies that were believed to be running collective investment schemes popularly but incorrectly referred to as chit funds in eastern india. it was feared that legitimate non-banking financial companies and microfinance institutions would be stigmatized, leading to a vicious cycle of low depositor trust, higher interest rates, lower lending and a localized credit crisis. because most of the saradha group depositors came from the lowest economic strata, the loss of the investment would cause a further decrease in social mobility. the scandal drew attention to similar illegal deposit mobilizing companies, which are facing increased regulatory pressure. many of these companies have been variations of timeshare travel schemes, of which there are few clear regulations. in august 2013, the central government amended the sebi act and gave sebi powers to search and seize without prior magisterial permission to investigate illegal money collection schemes.nsel case relates to a payment default at the national spot exchange limited that occurred in 2013 involving financial technologies india ltd when a payment default took place after a commodities market regulator, the forward markets commission (fmc), directed nsel to stop launching contracts. this led to the closure of the exchange in july 2013. three spot exchanges, nsel, nspot, and national apmc were exempted by the government under section 27 of fcra to conduct forward trading in one-day contracts. this was done to boost volumes so that their economic viability improved. on the flawed recommendations of the fmc, the ministry of consumer affairs ordered nsel to settle all existing contracts and not launch any fresh contracts, which led to the crisis. investigations led by enforcement directorate (ed) and economic offences wing (eow) revealed the role of brokers and defaulters in the nsel case. the brokers mis-sold nsel products to their clients by assuring them of fixed returns. the defaulters hypothecated stocks and produced fake warehouse receipts and siphoned the entire default money. fiu (under finance ministry) held that nsel came under the purview of the forwarding contracts (regulation) act (fcra) and therefore guilty of failing in several of these obligations under the law. the black money watchdog has slapped a penalty of rs 1.66 crore for several counts of violating the provisions of the prevention of money laundering act (pmla) on nsel. the watchdog further held that failures are deliberate and willful and hence, invite penalties.the nse co-location scam relates to the market manipulation at the national stock exchange of india, indias leading stock exchange. allegedly select players obtained market price information ahead of the rest of the market, enabling them to front-run the rest of the market, possibly breaching the nses purpose of demutualization exchange governance and its robust transparency-based mechanism. he alleged connivance of insiders by rigging nses algo-trading and use of co-location servers ensured substantial profits to a set of brokers. the whistle-blower alleged that trading members were able to capitalize on advanced knowledge by colluding with some exchange officials. in a written reply, minister of state for finance, arjun meghwal told the lok sabha in 2016: the architecture of nse with respect to dissemination of tick-by-tick through transmission control protocol (tcp) or internet protocol (ip) was prone to manipulation or market abuse.the punjab national bank fraud case relates to the fraudulent letters of undertaking worth 11,356.84 crores (us$ 1.4 billion) issued by the punjab national bank at its brady house branch in fort, mumbai; making punjab national bank liable for the amount. the fraud was allegedly organized by jeweler and designer nirav modi. nirav, his wife ami modi, brother nishal modi and uncle mehul choksi, all partners of the firms, m/s diamond r us, m/s solar exports and m/s stellar diamonds; along with pnb officials and employees, and directors of nirav modi and mehul choksis firms have all been named in a charge sheet by the cbi. the bank initially said that two of its employees at the branch were involved in the scam, as the banks core banking system was bypassed when the corrupt employees issued lous to overseas branches of other indian banks, including allahabad bank, axis bank, and union bank of india, using the international financial communication system, swift. on 1 march 2018, the government approved the fugitive economic offenders bill to deter economic offenders from evading the process of indian law by giving powers to the government to confiscate assets of a fugitive, including benami assets of absconding loan defaulters. the bill covers a wide range of economic offenders which include: loan defaulters, fraudsters, individuals who violate laws governing taxes, black money, benami properties, the financial sector, and corruption. in march 2018, the reserve bank of india scrapped banking instruments such as the letter of understanding (lou) and letter of comfort (loc) that in an attempt to plug a loophole and improve banks due diligence in trade credit. some bankers said that lous and locs led to receiving banks depending completely on the issuing bank on creditworthiness.as seen in all the above cases for scams like nirav modi, the two factors: action taken by the insiders or systemic loopholes were responsible for the majority of the indian financial scams. the improvement in the industry will only come when all the loopholes are closed down and accountability is given and held to all the people working in the industry.blackcoffer insights 16:- sandeep

altogether prepared for my last theater competition of this very year. i only knew in my core how much this competition meant for me. in the morning i made some last-minute calls to my diligent team who were ceaselessly practicing for the past few days to confirm to me that they were all coming for the competition because of the alarming coronavirus ball game going outside the market. it was not like i wasnt aware of the situation but i believed that i would be able to handle it because theres a quote in theatre that says, fear is only as deep as the mind allows and to some length i was fearless. my passion, fondness, and attachment for the theatre were above all the notices and announcements that were rolling out.but then at once, i received a call from mr. sandeep, the head of the event who told me that the event is put off till the next few days and from that precise moment onwards the journey of hard and strenuous days began and it in point of fact felt like it was all meant to happen. the competition was postponed, the team was stuck in their homes grudgingly, time was haunting us all because of this coronavirus. these were some of the cardinal ways in which this virus affected us but there was more to this sickness. this very sickness acted like a sadist. i was impressed as i found someone who could act better than me. it has reversed the ways we used to work, play and exercise and the world solution that was asked to practice by the professionals were social distancing. this virus was wild and dangerous towards the people who are in declining health conditions but obviously it could not take off his hands from the young people as well. the coronavirus cases and deaths were heightening to a great extent. also the major problem that came in the light was people being fully unprepared and this led to the public becoming snappier, intolerant and non-supportive needless to say as this virus was acting like a sadist. but by all means, our government knows how to best handle the affairs, they decided to shut down schools, colleges, bars anything that would involve the gathering of more than 10 people. with disinformation coming from all around related to this infection it becomes hard to judge for the audience what is true and what is false and it worsens when the public consumes this information by working from home. this virus was not only hollowing people from deep inside but was also supporting and increasing some other country-related issues one of which is fake news which is a serious problem.with fake news traveling around the world, people come and start to blabber. people start offering numerous solutions and want that most of the people should follow it. they start acting like saints who know all the solutions to this pandemic. some of the solutions are convenient to follow but some are not and are unhealthy which creates immense confusion and arguments. but the best way to stop the confusion and to avoid these people is to avoid their arguments and to not convince them with your points because it is rightly said a man convinced against his will is of the same opinions still. the thing to do is to look after your family and to avoid shady and deceitful people.but one thing that cant be avoided is our expanding and maturing industries that lend a hand in developing our nation but no power to choose is left with our industries but to be at a standstill in this current moment as coronavirus right now is winning the game. the untold number of industries is growing down and a major one is our tourism industries and if this continues to happen then in no time there will be a loss to jobs close to more than 75 million. many working people like in the tourism industry and not only in this peculiar industry but also in various others, people are getting suspended because of a hefty amount of lost revenue. one of my own family members resorted to this issue by working for free for the next few months in order to at least protect her job. who should be blamed for these kinds of situations is also a point of concern for many people.massive hunger will definitely kill the poor before this virus, this statement takes my immediate attention. what options are left with the daily-wage earners? i would say no option. they are the ones who are in the most condemning situations. lockdown for us can be a way to relax or listen to karaoke, but lockdown for them means an end to their life. unquestionably, this decision by our prime minister is the best he could take but when the best turns out to be the worst for someone then i think its a moment to question. going to the internet and writing whats the best way to spend this quarantine, should definitely be whats the best way in which we can help people, but naturally, this would not interest many people. furthermore, this set off to become more hell when people start with the activity of stockpiling. unnecessary piling of food is altogether a reason for shortage and ultimately hunger.my maid mala who is a housewife and has a small suffering family, i believe could have written this article in a better manner if she would have the relevant education because she is the actual prey to this problem. she being the patient will exactly know the impact this virus can have on our lives because sitting in our homes with a cup coffee can never let us know what an empty cup feels like. mala said to me think how much we would be tolerating that our prime minister apologized to the public for this lockdown which was certainly a good thing for the masses. what all i could do to help her was to provide her family with some money and eatables. a small contribution with some motivation and a call once in 2 days i believe will not improve her state completely but would certainly provide her with the power to deal with it. not only mala and her family, but there are also millions of people who are in the exact same condition. there are countless mala in our country who are panicking, enduring and suffering each night with no food in their stomachs. imagine an exact same situation for yourselves, it would without fail be the hardest situation. this is the impact a virus can create. for sure this article can be of endless pages owing to the fact that there are more stories to to this and each story is
painful that the other.labor chowk in noida has numerous stories of people conveying their problems and asking for help. this chowk is in the main know for men looking for work. quite a few men gather there each morning to get some work in order to feed their families with at least a roti but this virus even snatched that from their plates. a very known movie in our indian cinemas is coolie that says these laborers should get their pay till their sweat dries up. these people anyhow need money each day to feed their families but after these uncontrollable situations they at times are forced to eat filth and muck and this sickness might not kill these people but hunger and stained water definitely will. these stories will never end because its all meant to happen but i hope this situation does in order to provide some relief to them.also how one would imagine that the movie six feets apart would be acted in reality. the solutions related to this pandemic came swiftly and rapidly with the help and support of your doctors and nurses who all were serving us and the sufferers round-the-clock. solutions like washing your hands for at least 20 seconds correctly, covering your mouth with a face mask and majorly avoiding unnecessary wandering on the streets and keeping yourself away from unhygienic people were asked to follow. the efforts of our doctors, nurses, government officials made me realize that my passion should not be above these notices and announcements but should move hand in hand with it. right at this moment we all are moving with these circumstances and nobody knows what might happen in the future but one thing is of sure that nobody can ever forget this situation and indeed me as it had the ability to knock down my event that day. many lessons were learned by all the world in these days some being that never ever take anything for granted because if that thing or that person leaves then life tends to become like a rock. appreciate, admire and cherish whatever you have because you never know when it might leave you, ask from them who have just lost someone from this corona virus. moments to live happily in this world are very few spend it with someone who makes you feel loved. each day sun rises with a new hope to make a habit to feel the warmth and wish for a healthy life for yourself, your family and this world. together we all are fighting this virus with unity.

are commonalities among all the pandemics that occur and what we can learn from
them. one commonality is that it comes from animals and the other one is that
we wait too long.in the year 1720
plague, in the year 1820 cholera outbreak and the most recent pandemic was the
spanish flu of 1920. the researchers said that all of these pandemics above
have exactly the same pattern as the coronavirus outbreak. however, the
precision with which these pandemics occur at exactly 100 years of age makes us
think better about this topic.coronavirus disease (covid-19) is one such infectious disease that has been declared a global pandemic by who. most people infected with the covid-19 virus experience mild to moderate illness and recover without requiring special treatment. older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illnesses. the best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the covid-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. people can protect themselves and others from infection by washing their hands or using an alcohol-based sanitizer frequently and by not touching their face.the covid-19 virus spreads primarily through
droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or
sneezes, so its important that you also practice respiratory etiquettes (for
example, by coughing into a flexed elbow, etc). at this time, there are no
specific vaccines or treatments for covid-19. however, there are many ongoing
clinical trials evaluating potential treatments.the first case of this pandemic in india was
reported on january 30th,2020. after which it has increased
substantially around the country to such an extent that the indian prime
minister announced a 21-day lockdown around the country.rating agencies, both global and domestic, are unanimous that the covid-19 pandemic will be an economic tsunami for india. even though the country may not slip into a recession, unlike the eurozone, the us, or asia-pacific that have stronger trade ties to china, analysts believe the impact on indias gdp growth will be significant. the fallout of the move will spill over to the financial year 2021, which begins on april 1. moodys investors service, on march 27, sharply slashed its projection for indias gdp growth in the calendar year 2020 from 5.3% to 2.5%. the markdown was the second in 10 days and came after prime minister narendra modi announced the 21-day lockdown. in its global macro outlook 2020-21, moodys cited severe liquidity constraints in indias banking and non-banking sectors as a hindrance to growth. the agencys forecast for the global economy was even more starka contraction of 0.5% in the ongoing financial year.lower business volumes and occupancies, and
sub-optimal efficiencies will impact the profitability of companies. while some
affected companies may initiate cost-curtailment measures, these may not be
enough given their high fixed costs. that could impair their credit files,
says subodh rai, senior director, crisil.neeraj kumar, a migrant worker, decided to
flee. he and his family joined a throng of people leaving the city soon after the
lockdown announcement was made. public transport systems were stopped, leaving
people with no choice but to walk. mr. kumar, his wife, and their 10-year-old
daughter had already walked more than 40km (24 miles) when we spoke to him.
there is no work here, that is why we are running away. there are no
buses, i have to walk another 260km to get to my village, he said.the situation of workers following the lockdown is no better. mohammad alam is one of the thousands of workers standing in a food queue in indias capital, delhi.the
factory where he worked has shut down after prime minister narendra modi
announced a 21-day lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus.a daily-wage laborer, he has no other source of income, so he has been forced to come to a government center for food. i dont know how i will survive; i will have to borrow to feed my family, he says.india has announced a $23bn (18bn) relief packageto help people like mr. alam and mr. kumar who are part of indias unorganized, informal industry that employs 94% of the population and contributes 45% to its overall output. this industry is already bearing the brunt of the lockdown with thousands of finding themselves unemployed overnight. no-one will be allowed to go hungry, finance minister nirmala sitharaman said while announcing the package a combination of direct cash transfer benefits and food security measures.but the economic fallout of this unprecedented lockdown has been dire. businesses have closed, unemployment has risen and productivity has fallen. indias growth engine was actually sputtering well before the threat of the outbreak arrived. once one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, its growth slowed to 4.7% last year the lowest level in six years.unemployment was at a 45-year high last year. the industrial output from the eight-core sectors at the end of last year fell by 5.2% the worst in 14 years. small businesses had only just begun to recover from the controversial 2016 currency ban that came as a body blow to the cash-consuming informal economy. now, experts say the coronavirus outbreak is likely to further cripple the already frail economy.there is little finance minister nirmala sitharaman and rbi governor shatikanta das can do if covid-19 forces a virtual lockdown of commercial hubs in india, like it had done in china and has in italy. lights out in mumbai and delhi alone, the nerve centers of india, will cause great damage to the indian economy. indeed, covid-19 can be a massive blow to the slowing indian economy, particularly small business, the sme sector which had recently shown improvement since demonetization took place.this is a war-like situation for the indian economy as the malls and theatres are empty. schools are shut for contingencies and some states have even announced a complete shutdown of all services. so while most welcome the governments measures, they feel much more is needed to be done to minimize the economic impact. while free extra rations have been sanctioned, how will the poor access what is due to them? wonders economist arun kumar.the government should
devise a way of using the army and state machinery to physically distribute
food to the poor. with thousands of migrant workers stuck miles away from
their homes, the seamless distribution of cash and food needs to be the
governments top priority, he adds. and its not just migrant workers at risk.
farmers are also vulnerable to a potential economic shock from the lockdown the agriculture industry contributes nearly $265bn to gdp. the
government says it will give farmers 2,000 rupees ($30) in april as an advance
payment from an $80 annual pay-out to tide over the situation.this money will be inadequate because exports have stopped. prices
in cities will rise because of profiteering and in rural areas they will drop
because farmers wont be able to sell their crop, says economist arun
kumar. the outbreak has happened at a critical farming time the new crop is
ready, waiting to be sold. economists warn indias challenge will be in transporting this food from
villages to cities in the midst of the lockdown. if supply chains dont work
properly, a lot of food will be wasted and lead to massive losses for indian
farmers. experts warn that india is also at the brink of a major unemployment
crisis. economist vivek kaul says people who work for small businesses may end
up with job and salary losses. i know of places where companies are
actively discussing how many people they need to fire, he says and thats
not all. while no sector is immune to covid-19 disruption, some are more vulnerable. the tourism industry will see greater disruptions. the world travel and tourism council calculated that tourism generated 9.2% of the gdp and supported 42.673 million jobs. tourism dependent states like kerala, karnataka earn huge forex but if the disease continues many operators will be forced to go out of the business.in the exports industry while the gloom and doom surrounding covid-19 are palpable, the crisis might also throw up some great opportunities for india. there are already reports of several western manufacturers looking at moving their factories out of china. many indian chemical producers have gone on record at having received inquiries from western manufacturers who earlier never used to look towards india as a source. tapping these opportunities, however, will require some serious innovation on the policy front. indian policymakers need to hunker down and plan economic assistance that will not only help indias export sector survive the immediate crisis but also retain stability and resume growth in the medium to long-term.with flights suspended until mid-april, the shutdown is also
bound to push indias fast-growing aviation industry into peril. the centre for
asia pacific aviation (capa) has assessed that the indian aviation industry
will post losses worth nearly $4bn this year. this will likely have a cascading
effect, affecting the hospitality and tourism industries. hotels and restaurant
chains across the country are empty and are likely to remain so for several
months, sparking worries of large-scale layoffs. the automobile industry, a key
indicator of a countrys economic growth, has also been forced to hit the
brakes experts are estimating losses of nearly $2bn.so, is indias relief package enough?experts say its a drop in the ocean compared to bailouts in countries such as the us, china and singapore the stimulus package constituting about 0.8 percent of fy20 gdp, is not at par to address the urgent needs of smaller businesses. experts say that india definitely needs a larger stimulus package soon to help businesses this extraordinary crisis.desperate times call for desperate measures. india has done well in containing this dangerous virus but should act swiftly and decisively, to protect its economy. clearly there is a need for greater fiscal-monetary coordination to ensure an optimal policy response.blackcoffer insights 16:- manan batra(delhi college of arts and commerce) and akshat

39,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/impact-of-covid-19-on-the-global-economy-2/,Global Economy effected by Coronavirus - Blackcoffer Insights,"introductioncoronavirus disease (covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.most people infected with this covid-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory disease and recover withoutrequiringspecialtreatment. olderage people and those with underlying medicalproblemslikecardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.the best way to prevent and slow down transmission iswell informed about the covid-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. protect yourselfand others frominfection bywashingyourhandsorusingan alcohol-basedrub frequently and not touching your face.the covid-19 virus spreadsprimarily through droplets of saliva or discharges from the nose when an infected person suffering from coughs or sneezes, so it is important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).at this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for this virus. however, there are many ongoing clinical trials calculating potential treatments. which will continue to provide regular basis information as soon as clinical findings become availableimpactthe emergence of covid-19 is a tragic public-health emergency. the disease, one hopes, will be brought under control quickly, but the international monetary fund is already warning that economic growth in china may slow. as we watch the situation unfold, three broader risks to the global economy are also becoming more apparent and clear.the first risk is obviously in china itself. while the precise
origins of the disease remain unclear, it is hard to take a definite view on
whether outbreaks of this kind could be avoided for example, by better
control over hygiene in food markets. but it is painfully obvious that a lack
of transparency in china has contributed to fear and even signs of panic around
the world.as financial markets go down in 2007-2008, when the precise incidence of big risks is not well understood, people tend to assume the worse. rapidly falling asset prices may not contain much informationexcept that there is not much information to be had.the chinese
authorities surely do not have all the answers at this point, but their
inclination to suppress data and interpretation is tremendously unhelpful.second, the lack of american leadership is more painfully apparent every day. the united states has the strongest medical-health system and facilities in the world, with the capacity for research and development (government and private) that is second to none. yet president donald trumps administration seems to be concerned primarily with playing down the risks while keeping the virus out of the united states of america a nearly impossible task.the privatesectorisworkinghardon a vaccine, andthis iscommendable. unfortunately, over a longer period of time, the lack of a consistent market for such vaccines has undermined investment in this sector. by creating the worlds largest market for many drugs, the us effectively supports research across a wide range of ailments but only those for which there is large and steady demand in the us.even the most fervent believer in trumps america first must be willing to concede that it is not in americas interest for the rest of the world to become sick. these are us allies, friends, and customers. also, like it or not, few diseases will stop at americas borders. indeed, the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) has said that the question is not if, but rather when, covid-19 spreads domestically.the third risk is in emerging markets and developing countries. poorer countries are ill-equipped to deal with this kind of disease, as seen in african countries refusal to airlift their citizens from china.the news thatthecoronavirushas reached italy hasshaken world financial markets, but italy is a relatively well-organized and rich country. avibrant democracy ensures that people will quickly understand if containment and treatment measures are working.we should be much more concerned about other countries,where nutrition is worse, housing standards are weak, and disease transmission can occur much more readily. if these countries health systems come under pressure, the us, europe, and others should step up quickly with technical assistance and essential supplies. but here, too, there is so far a worrying lack of leadership.it seems unlikely that this disease will prove to be as deadly as some of those that our ancestors experienced. medical practice and public health have advanced a great deal.the cdc is an outstanding organization, and the world health organization has a strong track record when the chips are down.private-sector groups of dedicated doctors and nurses have performed extraordinarily well under the most difficult circumstances, such as dealing with ebola, when they are given a chance. we are fortunate to live in an age that has so many heroic people.still, this coronavirus is a warning. societies neglect access
to health-care systems and reduce investments in research and development at
great peril. diseases are always evolving, and we must continually increase our
capacity to understand and fight newly emerging threats.the best way forward is by strengthening science,training more scientists,and building more labs. countries that are able to do this like the us should share ideas and knowledge as widely as possible.investing more in science is an appealing economic proposition. given very high rates of social return,basic research across awiderangeof activitiesmore than pays for itselfbut this is not about economics. more likely than not, one day a scientist will save your life or the life of a loved one because his or her previous work produced a drug, treatment, or just an idea that made a critical difference. we should invest in scientists to save ourselves and our neighbors. also, we must remember that we have neighbors all over our deeply interconnected world.global
shares take a hitbig shifts in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, can affect many investments in pensions or individual savings accounts (isas).the
ftse, dow jones industrial average and the nikkei have all seen huge falls
since the outbreak began on 31 december.the dow and the ftse recently saw their biggest one-day declines since 1987.investors
fear the spread of the coronavirus will destroy economic growth and that
government action may not be enough to stop the decline.in
response, central banks in many countries, including the united kingdom, have
slashed interest rates.that should, in theory, make borrowing cheaper and
encourage spending to boost the economy.global
markets did also recover some ground after the us senate passed a $2 trillion
(1.7tn) coronavirus aid bill to help workers and businesses.but
some analysts have warned that they could be volatile until the pandemic is
contained.indian economyindia faces asharp decline in government revenues and economic growth for at least two quarters as the coronavirus hits economic activity and a fall in investor sentiment impacts privatization plans, government and industry sources said.officially, the government is still sticking to the target of achieving 6-6.5% in the next financial year beginning april,while hoping that a fall in crude oil prices could help it garner more revenue and contain a fall in revenue from other sectors but economists and bankers are turning increasingly downbeat about indias economic prospects, especially as the government is betting on filling its coffers through ill-timed asset sales. we are going to miss the revised revenue targets for the current fiscal year, and will have to lower next years targets as well, said a senior government official with direct knowledge of budget estimates.he said receipts from much-delayed privatization of indias second-biggest oil refiner, bharat petroleum corp, could be lower by at least $2 billion against initial estimates. the companys share prices have fallen by over 27% since january while the broader nse nifty50 index has fallen by nearly 20% following a panic in global markets.on
wednesday, the government suspended almost all visas to the country till april15 to prevent the spread of coronavirus as cases across the region continue to rise. total cases in the country rose to73onthursday,according to the government. another senior finance ministry official said some of the proposed share-shale plans in companies likecoal india,steel authority of india ltd (sail), nmdc and ircon have been deferred. the government now expects to raise about rs 50,000 crore ($6.75 billion) against the downwardly revised target of rs65,000 crore for the ongoing financial year ending in march,the official said. another senior official in the tax department said receipts have been hit due to a fall in consumer demand as reflected in the lower sales of autos, passenger traffic, hotel bookings, and retail sales.tour operators estimate january-march quarter earningscould fall by more than60% from a year ago as hundreds of thousands of tourists cancel travel, hitting hotels, airlines and tax collection for the federal and state governments. india attracts nearly one million foreign tourists a month, and the travel restrictions could impact for the next few months. the situation in india was still far better compared to some other countries hit by a global pandemic, sarkar said.india annually earns nearly $30 billion from foreign tourist arrivals, and the industry is worried that a global spread of the virus will harm already weakened economic growth.as this situation will take time to recover and economy not only of india but globally is in a recession it up to government how they come up with their measure.if we look at recent action of usfed and other countries step it took a thought that this pressure is deeper than it looks like and this situation is very different than that happen in 2008 crisis or that in 1998 as that time none of the factories are closed but this time work has been stoped and more importantly economy from past 1 year is facing slow down in many sectors so this will impact small companies badly.but if we think in another way there will be a shift in a lot of pattern like people will now go for short term investment in the stock market due to uncertainty of life, insurance stocks will be benefited, logistics & distribution network will totally change as factories will now try to procure material from nearest location and there will be an increase in the personal saving of people because of which automakers and real estate sector may be hit hard.if we estimate, it will take around 1 year to get back in a track from now and all this will happen if the government and central bank continuously come up with relief measure blackcoffer insights 16:- vishant agrawal, ibs gurgaon","['introductioncoronavirus', 'disease',

40,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/impact-of-covid-19-coronavirus-on-the-indian-economy-3/,Impact of COVID-19 (Coronavirus) on the Indian Economy - Blackcoffer Insights,"from the economic point of
view, india is confronted today with perhaps its greatest emergency since independence. the global financial
crisis in 2008-09 was a gigantic demand shock, but our workers could still get-up-and-go to work, our firms were coming off years of steady growth, our financial system was largely sound, and our government finances were blooming. none of this is true today as
we fight the
coronavirus pandemic. yet
there is also no reason to
despair. with the right undertakings and
priorities, and drawing on indias many sources of strength, it can kill this virus back, and even set the stage for a much more hopeful tomorrow.the rampant spread of covid-19 outbreak, across borders and geographies, has severely impacted almost the whole world and triggered significant downside risks to the overall global economic outlook. steps taken to contain its spread, such as the nationwide lockdown announced by the indian government, have brought economic activity to a near standstill with impacts on both consumption and investment. indias real gdp growth decelerated to its lowest in over 6 years in 3q 2019 2020 and the outbreak of covid 19 posted fresh challenges. for most businesses, the slowdown could be in the form of supply disruptions, fall in consumption demand, and stress on the banking and financial sectors. in sum the three major contributors to gdp will all get affected i.e. private consumption, investment and external trade.figure 1.1: showing quarterly growth in gdp (in %). source: mospiassessing the exact impact for india is hard
with uncertainty on how long the pandemic would last. three likely scenarios for indias economic situation could be:an
optimistic situation that shows a temporary impact of covid-19 and a v-shaped recovery: under this forecast scenario, the covid-19
pandemic in india could be controlled efficiently by june 2020. the
governments effective interventions may improve healthcare resources and
services, and indias economy could revive from q2 fy2021 onwards. scenario 1quarters q4 fy20 q1 fy21 q2 fy21 q3 fy21q4 fy22 gdp growth 4.04.2% 2.52.8% 4.14.3% 5.56.8% inflation moderate low around the target rate low rises but moderate figure 1.2: showing an optimistic situation. source: deloittea
somewhat optimistic scenario with a severe and extended impact of covid-19 and
a u-shaped recovery:
in the second scenario, india may see limited success in controlling the spread
despite the focus on public health-related measures and fiscal policies. with
stringent restrictions on movement, the current lockdown may extend until
september 2020. some industries will face pressure as rising debt and defaults
affect market sentiments, stress the financial sector, and reduce domestic demand.scenario 2quarters q4 fy20 q1q3 fy21 q4 fy21 q1 fy22 q4 fy23 gdp growth 4.04.2% 2.23.0% 4.24.4% 5.57.5% inflation moderate low moderates by q4 fy21 moderate rises above 4 % figure 1.3: showing an optimistic scenario with a severe and extended impact of covid-19. source: deloittein scenario 2, inflation picks up in h2 fy
2021 as demand revives faster than supply. inflation may increase above the
target range (4 percent) for a short time in fy 2021 because of economic
overheating. in this scenario, inflation remains 3-4 percent during this period
despite weak demand because of a sharper fall in production.a pessimistic situation, with a prolonged severe downturn leading to a new low-level normal: under the third scenario, the pandemic may spread rapidly (amidst strict movement restrictions) until q4 fy2021. due to the steep decline in demand, the economy will witness production cuts. the situation will ease only in q1 fy2022 after medical interventions. subsequently, the economy will revive modestly as consumers will continue to be wary of spending, which will affect long-term spending. over the next two years, the model predicts the economy to grow by 1.52%, lower than it would have grown otherwise, with unequal recovery across sectors.scenario 3quarters q4 fy20 q1q4 fy21 q1q4 fy22 q1 fy23q4 fy23 gdp growth 4.04.2% 2.23.5% 4.44.5% 56% inflation moderate moderate moderate figure 1.4: showing pessimistic situation, with a
prolonged severe downturn. source: deloitte.impact on the demand side:private
consumption: the
lockdown is likely to have a sizeable impact on the economy, most significantly
on consumption, which is the biggest component of gdp.steep fall in the consumption of non-essential goods due to a significant reduction in urban transactions.severe impact on the domestic supply chain disruptions due to the 21 day lockdown can affect the availability of essential commodities.weak domestic consumption and consumer sentiment will have firms delay their investment and putting additional pressure on growth.informal sector: rajasthan, punjab, andhra pradesh, chhattisgarh, and gujarat are among the top five states with the highest urban informal workers (nonagriculture)around 37 percent of regular salaried employees in urban india are informal workers, who will face uncertain income following the stalling of urban activity.inr 1.7 trillion stimulus package, focused majorly on cash transfer and food security was unveiled.the income shock to migrant workers has resulted in a massive reverse migration, the effect of which will only unravel over time.impact on the supply side:the shutdown of factories and the resultant delay in the supply of goods in china could result in the supply chain of both raw materials and intermediate goods for indian companies importing from there.while disruption in output in china could impact some indian industries, the economy at large may be relatively insulated given its low reliance on intermediate goods from china as well as the common practice in indian firms of stockpiling inventory.another challenge is the disruptions of the domestic supply chain due to the lockdown, which may create a shortage of inputs for indian firms when they restart their operations.

chain disruptions. source: the economic
times.what has been done so far?india has already undertaken the following
measures to counter the impact from of the pandemic:a three-week countrywide lockdown and fiscal steps, coupled with monetary measures from the rbi, to provide relief for all, especially the vulnerable and the disadvantaged a government has directed the employers to not terminate or cut wages, particularly that of casual or contractual workers, and low-paid workers to also take paid sick leave and unemployment allowance through the insurance cover government to contribute to both employees and employers share in the employees employees provident fund rbi relaxes lending norms for banks, injects cash into the system, slashes interest rates, and relaxes repayments for three months managing the pandemic and the resultant public health crisis protecting income and employment, particularly for the disadvantaged and vulnerable sections of the societywhat can the corporates do?the crisis is a story with an uncertain ending. however, what is clear that the covid-19 has introduced new challenges to the business environment which called for a measured, practical and informed approach from political and business leaders. a company needs to think and act across five horizons:resolve: address the immediate challenges that covid -19 represents the institutions workforce, customers, technology, and business partners.resilience: address near-term cash management challenges and broader resiliency issues during virus-related shutdowns and economy knock-on-effect.return: create a detailed plan to return the business to scale quickly as covid -19 situation evolves and knock-on-effects become clearer.reimagination: re-imagine the next normal: what a discontinuous shift looks like and implications for how institutions should re-invent reform: be clear about how regulatory and competitive environments in india may shift.figure
1.6: showing the
crisis as a lesson to businessmen in assessing risk to their business. source: the economic times collectively, these five stages epitomize the inescapable of our time: the battle
against covid-19 is one that leaders today must win in order to find an economically
and socially feasible path to the next normal.
what can the government do?
the government should consider certain measures in order to manage the pandemic. the following steps and the recognition of the likely scenarios for the indian economy can enable policymakers to identify appropriate countermeasures to stem the spread of the pandemic:
build a national database of the reachable physical health infrastructure and medical and para-medical resources the public and private health care facilities can be segregated by labeling a section of accessible hospital beds for treating covid-19 patients only extend additional one-time budgetary support to augment the public health care system in terms of facilities, equipment, and human resources capacity earmark financial resources to provide one-time grants/financial support to research institutions and leading pharmaceutical/biotechnology/medical equipment companies extend the coverage of ayushman bharat and other applicable insurance schemes to covid-19 if not already included tweak the existing customs duty structure for select components, which are essential for manufacturing testing kits, ventilators, etc.enable access to funds for businesses to run their day to day operations and service their debt ensure the smooth supply of essential products and commodities to contain the economic impact of the covid-19 outbreak provide credit support to medium and small enterprises encourage investments such as one-time set off of capital investments made by corporates for income-tax computations
therefore, the question remains whether the stimulus is enough or not both quantitatively and qualitatively? would it be able to help the economy absorb the shock of the lockdown? compared to what the usa (2 trillion usd), germany (610 billion usd), uk (424 billion usd), france (335 billion usd), spain (218 billion usd), china (78.8 billion usd) and italy (27.3 billion usd), the spending by india (1, 70,000 crore 22.5 billion usd) may prima facie appear to be insufficient. however, such a comparison is not easy and straightforward because a lot of factors are to be taken into account. in addition, the important factor that needs to be considered is whether at this point in time the country is able to spend more than this or not. against a revised budget estimate of rs. 21,63,000 crore for 2019-20 towards tax collections, the collection as on 31stdec 2019 was to the tune of rs. 13,83,000 crore only with a clearly huge shortfall. in addition, a substantial amount would also have to be spent now to tackle the pandemic which is of utmost priority. on top of it, huge additional spending would jeopardize the fiscal deficit discipline although, at times of emergency, fiscal deficit should not be a matter of concern at all.
it would also have to be seen how long this virus continues to affect india and going by the hygiene standard and herd mentality that we have, the virus continues to affect us beyond 3 months and extends to 6-8 months, quite obviously these packages would be grossly insufficient and more money will have to be pumped into the economy. if the need arises, currency notes will have to be printed and circulated and concerns about higher fiscal deficit should be simply pushed to the backseat. the corporate sector and a section of large-hearted people have also come forward at this time of distress to support the government initiatives in fighting this menace which should provide some financial comfort to the government.
the pandemic has appeared from nowhere as a potential death knell to the world economy which is already under stress and india is no exception. there is no second opinion that this pandemic has hit the world very hard and would continue to do so in the foreseeable future. whether india can emerge from the medical pandemic as well as the economic pandemic relatively unscathed remains to be seen. we will have to take care of our lives as well as the livelihoods of our citizens. as indians, we hope, we shall overcome. together we can do this and we will.

41,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/should-celebrities-be-allowed-to-join-politics/,Should celebrities be allowed to join politics | blackcoffer insights,"in todays day and age of hyper-connectivity, celebrities dubbed by fraser and brown (2002) as people who are famous for being famous and may or may not always serve others sacrificially live in glass houses that are open to the prying eyes of the public. notification bars are ever abuzz with news about when these celebrities wake up, what they wear to the gym, what they eat, and where they go on their vacations. in the idealized and idolized eyes with which society views celebrities, this unceasing visibility gives them an all-pervasive influence. the dominance of celebrities in swaying opinions of their acolyte is well-established from advertisements in the print and pixel mediums, brand endorsements, and integrations, the evidence of exploiting celebrity influence is vast. however, today more than ever before, this influence is creeping away from the world of consumerism and into governance, policy, and politics. with an increasing number of public figures overtly taking strong and stronger political stances, making moves charged with a political motive, and eventually entering the sphere of legislature and bureaucracy, the scope of having a public influence has come to mean much more than it used to, thereby begging the question how well-placed are personage in the world of politics? should celebrities be allowed to join politics?the interplay between the seemingly contrasting worlds of celebrities and policy-makers have come into increasing contact, in india and the rest of the world-leading pop-music artists back presidential candidates, internationally acclaimed actors attempt international diplomacy, films are claimed to be vehicles of political messaging, prime ministerial banquets engage celluloid stars, and so on. the influence that stars exert on the world of politics seems to encapsulate an entire spectrum of involvement at the zenith of which are the celebrities who actually set foot into parliamentary assemblies and councils, to represent the public that they once only influenced.although the phenomenon of the seeping of public influence into public policy has stretched through much of the 20th century, choi and berger (2001) suggest that the celebrity-politics connect continues to strengthen, much more than it did a few decades ago, as we trudge further into the century. of the myriad causalities that underlie this circumstance, the global internet, where fame isnt restricted to the confines of tangible achievement has been theorized to be a significant driver. in her 2009 book, hyde labels this spectacle as a mission creep, where the enterprise of celebrities is expanding beyond its primary goals.a prodigious public following seems to be the parallel between the worlds of politics and personage, which paves the path for celebrities to cross over to politics. celebrities seem to be able to transition into politics with a certain grace, having already learned to live in the publics eye, and established themselves, allowing the carry-over of their already-known traits as celebrities into their role as policy-makers. the visibility that autochthonous politicians work years to nurture, celebrities already have as they descend into the political sphere. in one of the best-known instances of a celebrity transitioning into politics, ronald reagan walked away from hollywood and into the white house, carrying with him his trademark charismatic on-screen personality that spilled over into his politics. initially serving as the governor of california for 15 years in the late 1960s, reagan served two terms at the oval office. the voters knew who ronald was those who closely followed the trends of the red and blue but also those who did not, giving reagan the edge that propelled him towards success. on the other side of the globe, india saw much the same trend as an on-screen persona aiding the creation of an off-screen political career. ramanand sagars television series ramayan, based on the hindu mythological epic, was revolutionary in the pious indian society of the 1980s when television shows were still novel. it has been recounted on many an occasion that audiences would often offer their prayers to the television screen, every time arun govil, who portrayed the deity ram made an appearance on screen. having garnered a devout, dutiful fan following, govil, and his other co-actors from the show turned to the world of politics, where their godly association in the publics eyes helped them make a mark. even the philippines has shown ample evidence of celebrities time and again swooping in to claim political victory with their stardom and popularity, that their opponents lack.very often, the sentiment of anti-incumbency seems to be the golden ticket that lets celebrity politicians snatch political power from consummate politicians. indeed, various political theorists suggest that anti-incumbency happens to be amongst the more effective strategies to secure vote banks. until 31st december 2018, ukrainian actor, screenwriter, and director volodymyr zelensky only played the lead in a sitcom that tells the story of a schoolteacher who accidentally becomes the president. it was that winter that zelensky claimed that he was contesting the presidential elections to change the mood and timbre of the political establishment and to bring professional, decent people to power. zelensky took the premise of his wildly popular show from the reel to the real, as he crushed rival, a seasoned politician, and incumbent poroshenko in a landslide victory. has zelensky proved a better representative of his people than his predecessor? time is yet to deliver its verdict. but the gushes that he invoked in the people of ukraine, and his plea to oust the ruling class played their role in assuring zelensky 73% of the plebiscite. in the early 2010s in india, similar anti-incumbent sentimentalities were played into by the many celebrities including musician vishal dadlani, hockey legend dhanraj pillay, singer jaspinder narula, and others all of whom joined hands with arvind kejriwals aam aadmi movement that aimed to rid the existing political system of its ills.and so, innumerable celebrities across countries and cultures claim the throne. in fact, a wikipedia page that maintains an inventory of actor-politician spanning the atlas claims that it may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness depicting the sheer number of celebrities who reroute to politics. this begets questioning the congruence of the world of personage and that of politics.in a research article published in 1995, meyer and gamson articulated the possibility of celebrities choosing to politically address only broadly acceptable social causes because they understand their power rests with staying popular, thereby failing to make any appreciable difference. this seems to ring true with some celebrity politicians in india, especially ones who are nominated to the upper house of the parliament but fail abysmally to leave a mark. one of many such representatives is gautam gambhir, a cricketer-turned-politician who has mostly been shunned for his abject performance in the parliament. hema malini, another popular actress who turned to politics, came under heavy criticism when her claim to be a protector of womens rights wasnt backed by an effort to fulfill her promises. owing to such instances, research findings such as those by nisbett and dewalt (2016) find that the public often questions the intentions of the celebrities who venture into politics. it may also seem that in entering politics and failing to deliver, celebrity politicians often deprive grass-root political workers of the chance to enter the mainstream of politics.however, there is ample evidence from around the globe that goes to prove that celebrities can, in fact, make their mark in the world of governance, independent of their primary identities. take the south indian state of tamil nadu, for instance, where the political ethos has been consistently overshadowed by celebrities from the world of showbiz, for at least the last 40 years. as per data from the ministry of statistics & programme implementation, tamil nadu is amongst the top-performing states in the country, having the second-highest gdp. most celebrities in tamil nadu who approached politics have exhibited extraordinary political will and caliber. the late actor-politician j. jayalalithaa, or amma, ran successful terms as chief minister and is still considered a mother figure by hordes of her followers. another stalwart in the landscape of tamil nadu, dr. mg ramachandran, continues to be celebrated as one of the most influential chief ministers and is lauded for his large-scale reforms. in being the forerunner of some of the changes that propelled the state towards progress, including easing caste tensions and other communal violence, mgr as he is better known, is remembered as much for his governance as he is for his innings on screen.more often than not, celebrity engagement in politics has been used to woo voters from the younger strata of the population. empirical studies such as the one by austin, vord, pinkleton, and epstein (2008), have conclusively shown to enhance political engagement by younger voters. along similar lines, jackson (2008) found that young people are more likely to agree with political positions that are endorsed by politicians. in fact, many modern political theorists are of the belief that the involvement of celebrities in politics allows for otherwise uninvolved or apathetic veins of the demographic, to be active participants in democracy. hillary clinton aimed to do just that when she got the billboard-topping artists beyonce and jay-z to take center-stage at her rally in cleveland, in the weeks leading up to the 2016 us presidential elections in fact, as multiple sources suggest, this rally did see a surge in millennial supporters. in such a case, it might be in the benefit of the community to have more celebrities endorse and engage in politics in order to nurture a more vibrant and engaged youth.from our vantage point today, the relationship between personage and politics seems to be a central fixture in society and is here to stay. what remains to be done, however, is to ensure the symbiotic course of this relationship to scrutinize and critique the celebrities who knock the doors of politics and to secure their promises of beneficence and non-maleficence to the public that it seeks to serve. yet, it may seem that these are benchmarks that need to be met by any and all servants of the people celebrity or not, but in the world that we live in, this is certainly not the case. politicians celebrity or not, largely happen upon the sphere of governance without a lot of experience backing them and learn to navigate the maze of politics on the job. ultimately, like all things in democracy, the government is of the people and its representatives are of them, and for them. the eventual endorsement of its leaders celebrity or not can come, not from data-based analyses and elaborate critique, but from the people. should celebrities be allowed to enter politics? the question remains unanswered. or rather, is answered by the democratic exercise itself with the beeps of electronic ballots election after election, when the people the real influencers, choose.","['today', 'day', 'age', 'hyper', 'connectivity', 'celebrity', 'dubbed', 'fraser', 'brown', 'people', 'famous',

state of the public healthcare system, still vast, is very fragmented and cannot scale up rapidly enough to face the challenge of a pandemic such as covid-19. the origin of public healthcare lies in the british colonial period where such facilities were provided only to british officers and their families stationed in india. from the 1960s onwards, the independent government of india stressed more upon healthcare and it led to the creation of the modern public healthcare system in india. the healthcare system is organized into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. at the primary level are sub centres and primary health centres (phcs). at the secondary level there are community health centres (chcs) and smaller sub-district hospitals. finally, the top level of public care provided by the government is the tertiary level, which consists of medical colleges and district/general hospitals. the number of phcs, chcs, sub centres, and district hospitals has increased in the past six years, although not all of them are up to the standards set by indian public health standards. but there are still critical challenges to the existing system.one of the major areas is the lack of awareness of diseases, especially communicable diseases among the general population of india. this challenge becomes more complicated at the lower strata of society, especially poor households, migrant laborers and homeless people who do not have the proper channels of communication available to get the necessary information from the health experts. add low educational status, poor functional literacy, low accent on education within the healthcare system, and low priority for health in the population, among others and you see the magnitude of the problem. according to a recent study initiated by the faculty and students of iit-hyderabad and iit-bombay, in tier-1 cities, it was found that about 12 percent of the respondents switched from public to private mode during the third week of covid-19. this modal shift was about 9 percent in tier-2 cities and about 7 percent in tier-3 cities. moreover, nearly 48 percent of people said that they did not travel to work during the third week of march, whereas 28 percent had the same frequency of travel to work. when inquired about the cancellation of trips between the cities using major modes of transportation, around 18 percent said they cancelled their flights whereas, 20 per cent of respondents cancelled their train journeys. this indicates that awareness about covid-19 is higher in tier-1 cities, in comparison with tier-2 and tier-3 cities. but national level, state level and door-to-door campaigns along with targeted media campaigns may enable the knowledge of the pandemic to spread fast among the local populace.the second challenge is access to public healthcare in india. access (to healthcare) is defined by the oxford dictionary as the right or opportunity to use or benefit from (healthcare) physical reach is one of the basic determinants of access, defined as the ability to enter a healthcare facility within 5 km from the place of residence or work. using this definition, a study in india in 2012 found that in rural areas, only 37% of people were able to access ip facilities within a 5 km distance, and 68% were able to access out-patient facilities. furthermore, it was postulated that in general, the more rustic (rural) ones existence the further one lives from towns the greater are the odds of disease, malnourishment, weakness, and premature death.the third is the planning portion related to the preparedness of the pandemic. planning for a pandemic such as covid-19 has never been done extensively in india as we had no recent history of such a communicable disease which spreads rapidly in crowded locations, which about a quarter of the population live in. the recent national lockdown called led to an increase in police violence who have not been sensitized how to deal in such a crisis and the humanitarian crisis facing migrant laborers, an important part of the indian economy, who have lost their jobs and facing a lack of public transport, have to force to walk thousands of miles to reach their native villages. the ongoing slump in the economy has been further exacerbated by the pandemic and the resultant lockdown. and there have been growing complaints by healthcare professionals, who are fighting in the front of this pandemic, of lack of protective personal equipments (ppes) to protect themselves and their patients from covid-19. the lockdown has hit hiv+ and chronic patients hard who need constant medication to maintain their fragile condition. elderly people, who are often alone and have medical conditions, have been left without essential support. ironically, these are the same group of people who are at an immediate threat from covid-19.i am optimistically hoping, based on the ingenious and creativity of our citizens, that we tide over these tough times and fundamental changes to our healthcare system are made with this sober learning experience to prevent a repeat of what is happening today.","['frankly', 'state', 'public',

43,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-will-covid-19-affect-the-world-of-work/,How will COVID-19 affect the world of work? - Blackcoffer Insights,"every prophet of doom, unless he also happens to be a psychopath, hopes that his predictions will not be borne out. this is also true for the epidemiologists and virologists who have been warning the world since january that the novel sars-cov-2 virus poses a severe threat to public health around the world. the name coronavirus itself, is vicious enough to terrify those who otherwise are fearless in the face of any ball game. tracing back the origins of the now pandemic, we find that the coronavirus emerged in wuhan, a city of 11 million people in chinas hubei province, in late 2019. cases of the disease grew by several thousand per day in china in late january and early february, the peak of the epidemic there. the number of infections appearing each day has since plummeted in china, making the outbreak a global pandemic that has engulfed over 214 countries around the globe.besides being a health crisis, the virus has already brought a major downfall in the world economy with the imf estimating the coronavirus-induced global downturn to be way worse than financial crisis. as the coronavirus spreads across the globe, it appears to be setting off a devastating feedback loop with another of the gravest forces of our time: economic inequality. research suggests that those in lower economic strata are likelier to catch the disease owing to their inability to meet the rising drug prices. according to the international labour organization(ilo), covid-19 will have far-reaching impacts on labor market outcomes. beyond the urgent concerns about the health of workers and their families, the virus and the subsequent economic shocks will impact the world of work across three key dimensions.initial ilo estimates point to a significant rise in unemployment and underemployment in the wake of the virus. based on different scenarios for the impact of covid-19 on global gdp growth, preliminary ilo estimates indicate a rise in global unemployment of between 5.3 million (low scenario) and 24.7 million (high scenario) from a base level of 188 million in 2019. the mid scenario suggests an increase of 13 million (7.4 million in high-income countries). though these estimates remain highly uncertain, all figures indicate a substantial rise in global unemployment. for comparison, the global financial crisis of 2008-9 increased unemployment by 22 million. while self-employment does not typically react to economic downturns, it acts as a default option for survival or maintaining income often in the informal economy. for this reason, informal employment tends to increase during crises. however, the current limitations on the movement of people and goods may restrict this type of coping mechanism.labour supply is declining because of quarantine measures and a fall in economic activity.at this point, a preliminary estimate suggests thatinfected workers have already lost nearly 30,000 work months, with the consequent loss of income (for unprotected workers). employment impacts imply large income losses for workers. overall losses in labour income are expected in the range of between 860 and 3,440 billion usd.the loss of labour income will translate into lower consumption of goods and services, which is detrimental to the continuity of businesses and ensuring that economies are resilient. working poverty is also likely to increase significantly.the strain on incomes resulting from the decline in economic activity will devastate workers close to or below the poverty line. the growth impacts of the virus used for the unemployment estimates above suggest an additional 8.8 million people in working poverty around the world than originally estimated (i.e. an overall decline of 5.2 million working poor in 2020 compared to a decline of 14 million estimated pre-covid-19). under the mid and high scenarios, there will be between 20.1 million and 35.0 million more people in working poverty than before the pre-covid-19 estimate for 2020.who are particularly vulnerable?epidemics and economic crises can have a disproportionate impact on certain segments of the population, which can trigger worsening inequality.based on past experience and current information on the covid-19 pandemic and insights from previous crises, a number of groups can be identified:those with underlying health conditions and older peopleare most at risk of developing serious health issues.young persons, already facing higher rates of unemployment and underemployment, are more vulnerable to falling labor demand, as witnessed during the global financial crisis.womenare over-represented in more affected sectors (such as services) or in occupations that are at the front line of dealing with the pandemic (e.g. nurses). the ilo estimates that 58.6 percent of employed women work in the services sector around the world, compared to 45.4 percent of men.unprotected workers, including the self-employed, casual, and gig workers, are likely to be disproportionately hit by the virus as they do not have access to paid or sick leave mechanisms, and are less protected by conventional social protection mechanisms and other forms of income smoothing.migrant workersare particularly vulnerable to the impact of the covid-19 crisis, which will constrain both their ability to access their places of work in destination countries and return to their families.the extent and severity to which the coronavirus pandemic will impact the fight to end extreme poverty is still unknown, but it is expected that the crisis will devastate the worlds most vulnerable people including the world of work. the virus is already disproportionately impacting the poor in wealthy countries, where the most known cases are concentrated. experts are urging the world to prepare to lend extra support to low-income countries to address the pandemic. covid-19 cases are more likely to go undetected or to be under-detected in developing countries that have fewer resources available to tackle a pandemic. countries with large poor populations including brazil, india, indonesia, nigeria, and pakistan have confirmed few cases, but have been slow to respond to the threat, according to npr. preventative care and health education areless accessibleto low-income people who aremore likelyto have pre-existing conditions, catch covid-19, and die from it. people living in poverty are also more likely to holdinsecure jobsand cannot afford to stay home sick from work.in times of crisis, international labour standards provide a strong foundation for key policy responses that focus on the crucial role of decent work in achieving a sustained and equitable recovery to mitigate the impacts of covid-19 on the world of work. these standards, adopted by representatives of governments, workers and employers organizations, provide a human-centered approach to growth and development, including by triggering policy levers that both stimulate demand and protect workers and enterprises.policy responses should focus on two immediate goals: health protection measures and economic support on both the demand- and supply-side of the associated cause.first, workers and employers and their families should be protected from the health risks of covid-19. protective measures at the workplace and across communities should be introduced and strengthened, requiring large-scale public support and investment.second, timely, large-scale, and coordinated policy efforts should be taken to provide employment and income support and to stimulate the economy and labor demand. these measures not only cushion enterprises and workers against immediate employment and income losses, but they also help prevent a chain of supply shocks (e.g. losses in workers productivity capacities) and demand shocks (e.g. suppressing consumption among workers and their families) that could lead to a prolonged economic recession.in such challenging times, many countries have come forward to protect their workers in the workplace with decisive measures to combat the spread of the disease, while ameliorating its pernicious effect on the economy and labor market across the three policy pillars: protecting workers in the workplace, stimulating the economy and labor demand, and supporting employment and income. some of the policies include working arrangements, including telework; occupational safety and health (osh) advice; expanded access to paid sick leave; prevention of discrimination and exclusion. while these measures will no doubt help to contain the pandemic, to respond to the emergency needs it has generated and to pave the way to a gradual recovery, it is clear that more needs to be done. past crises and the experiences of countries, which have reacted too late in the context of the current covid-19 crisis, show that preparedness and early action is critical.the coronavirus pandemic is a test. its a test of medical capacity and political will. its a test of endurance and forbearance, for believers a test of religious faith. its a test, too, of a different kind of faith, in the strength of the ideas humans choose to help them form moral judgments and guide personal and social behavior. the epidemic forces everyone to confront deep questions of human existence, questions so profound that they have previously been answered, in many different ways, by the greatest philosophers. its a test of where all humans stand. what is right and what is wrong? what can individuals expect from society, and what can society expect of them? should others make sacrifices for me, and vice versa? is it just to set economic limits to fighting a deadly disease? how long will we stay that way? and as the epidemic grows worse and brings the disease within fewer degrees of separation for everyone, we may well find that the notion of loving thy neighbor as thyself becomes far more potent.at last i would like to conclude by saying that covid-19 is something we all face as a community, and thus something that we have tosolveas a community, not with weapons, but with goodwill and common efforts.blackcoffer insights 17:-adamya patel","['every', 'prophet', 'doom',

44,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/controversy-as-a-marketing-strategy/,Controversy as a Marketing Strategy - Blackcoffer Insights,"organizations burn a lot of resources to build one iconic image. their brand is not just a picture, a logo, and colors; but an emotional connection with the consumer. it develops by making an impression on the consumers each time they interact with the products or services and it becomes ingrained in the consumers minds. now, if it takes great efforts to build such impression, recognition, and trust, why would a firm do something controversial that could burn their own hands?we see hundreds of ads a day, but only a few get noticed. here is where a controversy comes into play. we would definitely notice something that disagrees with our thoughts or mentally disturbs us. so, such ads stand out. in controversy marketing, a firm creates a controversy which gains them attention really quick, and the word spreads widely. they believe that in order to stand out, they cant play it safe always. a controversial campaign could be about a social issue that could divide the masses, stating political opinions, or presenting something that doesnt associate with their image etc.key features of a well-crafted controversial campaign:choosing the correct subject. it could be a taboo or a debatable topic. while, both would be controversial, a taboo is more likely to draw a flack than a debatable topic.the campaign should be more focussed on the issue than on the brand itself. as a result, the debate would be about the issue and not the brand.the campaign should always promote a respectful and healthy discussion; not a fight or abuse. it should present the facts and avoid over-sensitising the issues.no issue/current situation should be exploited to a point where it becomes the tone of the firm. if a controversy does not settle down early, over the time it would become a part of the image of the company.the firm should be always prepared with a contingency plan or a proper response in case if the campaign backfires or does not take the expected course.advantages of controversial marketing:increasing awareness: a well crafted ad can draw the attention of the unaware audience, making them explore the brands product portfolio. some of them, might be potential customers.shifting brand image: a brand always needs to evolve, as per the needs of its target audience. here, a controversial marketing strategy could be used to shift the image in a short span. it could also define the future path for the brand.emotional connect: if a brand is successful in winning the heart of a consumer, it half the job is done. even if a controversy can divide the audience, some will appreciate the message of the brand. they will relate more to the brand and can become loyalists.start a meaningful discussion: particularly if the campaign is designed around a social issue; the campaign not only becomes relevant to the company but also to the society. it breaks the stigma around a topic that people frown to talk about. by communicating to the masses about such a topic, the company eases the air, which can lead to healthy discussions.boost sales: the most important aspect. if the brand is able to build on the sudden increase in awareness among people, it could boost sales and profitability.disadvantages of controversial marketing:offensive: in present times, the audience have become highly sensitive and a controversial ad will definitely offend someone. so, we have to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before creating something controversial.ruin brand reputation: as stated earlier, it puts a high risk on brand reputation. for some consumers, a controversy might also become a reason to not buy the product or service. specifically, in case of media houses, if a media house gets involved in controversies often, then that reduces their credibility.while it can increase the awareness in a short span of time, it wont work in the long run as this attention is short lived.internet. they say, anything that goes on the internet, stays on the internet. due to rise of social media, people have become more conscious of their choices and try to thoroughly evaluate everything. as a result, even one controversial campaign will not be forgotten. years from now, if the company tries to change their opinion on some issue, then these old controversies will again come up and harm them deeply.a controversial campaign can also attract legal penalties, if it ends up leading to disharmony in the society.examples of controversial marketing strategies:movie makers frequently follow controversy as a tactic to create a buzz around their upcoming movie.nike came up with believe in something. even if it means sacrificing everything. campaign that had colin kaepernick who was outcast from nfl as he kneeled during national anthem to protest against racial inequality in nfl. the ad was a huge success, and nikes sales rose by31%.the uns womens auto-complete truth was a huge success as a campaign, and garnered huge accolades from media houses. here, it focused on gender gap and how it was perceived that some roles could never be donned by women.not all campaigns end in success. zomato gathered a lot of backlash in its subtle advertising campaign where they used indian slangs in their banners put up at public places.starbucks red-cup campaign. it created a huge buzz, and boosted sales, but it drove away a portion of christian customers, who were offended by it.in the end, we can say that controversial marketing is a double-edged sword. on one side, it benefits the firm by increasing its reach to the masses, and making more people conscious about the brand; on the other, it puts the brand value itself at stake. so, it has to be carefully planned, and a backup measure should always be kept ready to reduce the impact in case it backfires. every such campaign should be thoroughly weighed in for the losses and benefits before execution.","['organization', 'burn', 'lot', 'resource', 'build', 'one', 'iconic', 'image', 'brand', 'picture', 'logo', 'color', 'emotional',

implement containment measures, energy supply and demand is being disrupted. the impact that country-wide lockdowns and demand slowdowns will have on energy markets will be evolving every day.impact on energy markets are:i)slump in wind expansion may support german power prices:the recent slump in german wind capacity is likely to continue this year as complicated regulations and weakness in the global economic outlook due to the coronavirus are likely to dampen investment in the renewable technology.this has the potential to restrict future additions to wind output, impacting supply and, in turn, supporting power prices.ii)chinese industrial gas demand remains weak in march:chinese natural gas demand from the industrial sector in marchwas down by almost 25%year on year, according to the chongqing gas and petroleum exchange released over easter, as the impact of the coronavirus continued to weigh on consumption.iii)reduced energy offtake likely to hit uk suppliers:a growing number of british energy suppliers could be at risk of colllapsingthrough reduced energy offtake and cash-flow constraints amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to industry sources polled by icis.iv)breakdown of european power demand impact:power consumptioncontinued to softenacross key european demand centres through march and the first week of april, while less stringent measures and colder weather has sheltered other parts of europe.v)brexit set to ensure eu 2020 renewable goals:while the coronavirus outbreak is already having a significant impact on the european renewables sector, one unintended consequence of the pandemic is likely to be theachievement of eu and member state binding renewable energy targets for 2020. this is due to the consequences of a prolonged downturn in demand, which will not be normalised for by the eus official statistics office (eurostat), meaning that renewables look set to make up a higher share of consumption in 2020 across the eu.vi)spanish prices stay bearish but premium to france to persist:spanish power prices across the curve are expected to maintain a bearish trajectorythroughout the nationwide coronavirus lockdownperiod which was recently extended until 26 april, with further extensions possible.nevertheless, forecasts for below-average wind generation would support spanish spot prices,allowing france to continue exporting power to spain. this in turn should keep spanish near-curve contracts at a premium to their french equivalents.vii)coronavirus hits truck-loaded lng demand:market sources have indicated the coronavirus has reduceddemand for truck-loaded lngaround europe, as countries have implemented lockdown measures and low oil prices have made gas less competitive as a transport fuel.data from terminals in northwest europe shows the impact has not been as significant as originally thought.viii)europe has found a coronavirus electricity demand floor:electricity consumption has leveled outin germany, france and italy, after falling for several weeks due to restrictions aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus.but in great britain and spain, demand has continued to drop week on week in recent days, according to an icis model that controls for the impact of temperature across europes five largest consumers of electricity.ix)european power and carbon markets affected by covid-19 an early impact assessment:in order to assessthe fundamental impact of covid-19 on european power and carbon markets we modelled a scenario in which we accounted for the first data on dropping electricity demand as well as assumed industry production cuts and continued travel restrictions.x)india defers on lng cargoes as lockdown ramps up:india buyers are deferring lng cargoesas ports close operations with strict lockdowns in place. this is a concern for sellers in a long market with india one of the key buyers.xi)eu to reach 2020 renewables goals on coronavirus, brexit:the combination of brexit and lower demand associated with the coronavirus pandemic should enable the eu as a whole as well as many member states toreach their 2020 renewable targets, according to icis model run.xii)european power markets yet to hit coronavirus demand floor:european power demand will continue to dropas governments escalate measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus.electricity consumption in italy and france fell 16% below expectations over the past seven days, according to an icis model that controls for the impact of temperatures.three other major power markets studied by icis germany, spain and the uk have seen smaller drops, although all are trending down.xiii)virus demand hit to wipe 9% off 2020 european power prices: power demand drop likely icis model indicates 6% drop in demand during 2020 price fall of 9% across europea scenario where power demand drops one-tenth through up to june as a result of measures taken to slow the spread of the coronavirus would see power pricesacross european marketsfall by an average 9% in 2020.xiv)weather-driven nbp prompt upside possible in week 13: temperatures across nw europe to tumble in week 14 british local distribution zone demand to increase eax-nbp premium gainingincoming cooler weather across britain for week 14 could encourage buying acrossnbp prompt and near curve contractsin the coming sessions. the drop in temperatures will likely trigger a spike in heating demand which has also increased due to large numbers of people working from home to curb the spread of the coronavirus.xv)southeast europe braced for falling demand, bankruptcies:eastern european and turkish energy companies arebraced for sharp drops in demand and potential bankruptciesas countries introduce emergency measures in a bid to contain the coronavirus outbreak.although the spread of the virus is not as extensive in this region as in italy or spain, the impact of the emergency measures that have been taken is likely to be felt acutely because national economies are fragile.xvi)europe on course for sharp reduction to power demand:power sector demand across key european countries isset for a major slumpover the coming weeks as countries scale-up their efforts to tackle the spread of the coronavirus.demand in italy, which has been hit the hardest by the outbreak, has dropped 10% compared to its five-year average for march during the second week of its nationwide lockdown.as measures to tackle the spread of the virus intensifies across other european countries, a similar drop in demand can be expected, although changes are unlikely to be uniform.xvii)chinas city gas demand steady despite coronavirus, uncertain elsewhere:the impact of the coronavirus in china has reduced but gas demand will still end march well down from 2019.city-gate gas demand has been firmbut the outlook for other sectors remains a concern.xix)european gas centres set for april demand destruction: eu-wide demandcrunch could followafter lockdowns intensify residential demand to see brief increase before falling on warmer temperatures lng sellers could struggle to deliver into europexx)coronavirus effects to ripple in mexico:mexicos economy has perhapsnever been more exposedto the global supply chains and commodity markets hit by the shocks of the coronavirus and the oil price war, but its president is losing time engaging in denial and political pandering. these will not help his partys 2021 election prospects if the countrys economic performance falls further as its currency takes a beating amid capital flight.xxi)chinas gas demand rebounds satellite data:emissions of nitrogen dioxide are on the rise in china. this is an indication that economic activity is rising asbusinesses and industry ramp up activitywith the coronavirus impact subsiding.xxii)spanish virus to impact lng imports:spain is home to one third of europes lng import capacity, so a lockdown has the potential tofurther gum up the global lng supply chain if, as seems likely, it leads to a drop in demand for gas and a reduced ability to support scheduled imports.xxiii)european nuclear plant operators gear up to ensure power supply:european nuclear power availability isexpected to remain robustwith strict safety measures already being implemented by the major plant operators amid the coronavirus outbreak.xxiv)bulgarian power traders call for nuclear maintenance change:bulgarias free energy market association asep hascalled for measuresto tackle national power market disruption due to the coronavirus outbreak on 16 march.xxv)global market moves feed energy downside jitters:heightened concerns surrounding the economic fall-out from the coronavirus is set tofurther weigh on european energy markets, traders say.xxvi)coronavirus likely to lower trader appetite for risk:widespread remote working due to the coronavirus is set tohit european natural gas and power liquidity, according to traders.a number of firms have already asked traders to work from home or are expected to do so.while some trading activities around gas and power dispatching need to be done from a trading floor, most other tasks can be done from home.however, traders indicated it is unlikely to be business as normal with participants increasingly risk averse away from an office environment.xxvii)italian gas demand plunges on coronavirus restrictions:the coronavirus outbreak took a toll onitalian gas demandin week 11 as the government extended nationwide restrictions against the spread of the virus.if restrictions continue, demand and gas prices are likely to fall further as warmer temperatures follow spring, pressuring consumption for heating. power prices are also expected to plunge on the back of weaker gas. gas is italys main source for power generation and the marginal fuel, therefore a price maker for italian power.xxviii)expect weakness in chinese summer gas demand: coronavirusimpact on lpg to worsen chinas big three will have sought some lng volume deferrals as another means by which to deal with the mounting oversupply incremental demand for gas and lng this summer will be unusually lowxxix)coronavirus fails to pull down italian power demand significantly:the italian wholesale electricity market has so faravoided major lossesfollowing the outbreak of the coronavirus in the country, the strongest so far across europe.blackcoffer insights 17:- harsh arya, ajay kumar garg engineering college(up)","['coronavirus', 'spread', 'around',

policies,"from alibaba to ping an and google to ford, companies around the globe are telling staff to figure from directly from home in a bid to stem the spread of covid-19. such remote functioning at scale is unprecedented and can leave a long-lasting impression on the way people live and work for several years to return. china, which felt the primary impact of the pandemic, was an early mover during this space. as home to a number of the worlds largest firms, it offers lessons for people who are just commencing to embrace the shift. working from home skyrocketed in china within the wake of the covid-19 crisis as companies told their employees to remain home. around 200 million people were working remotely by the tip of the chinese new year holiday. while this arrangement has some benefits, like avoiding long commutes, many employees and firms found it challenging. one employee at a web company quipped his workday changed from 996 to 007, meaning from nine to nine, 6 days every week, to all or any the time. on the private front, employees found it difficult to manage kids home-schooling via video conference while coordinating with remote colleagues. at an organization level, many felt that productivity rapidly tailed off if not managed properly. if done right, remote working can boost productivity and morale; done badly, it can breed inefficiency, damage work relationships, and demotivate employees. these kind of things are happening due to the impacts of covid-19 on the world of workhere are a few of the learnings from china that will be applicable around the world, looking at the circumstances:designing an effective structure due to the impacts of covid-19 on the world of workteams or whole business units working remotely can quickly end in confusion and a scarcity of clarity. being isolated ends up in uncertainty about who to speak to on specific issues and the way and when to approach them, resulting in hold-ups and delays. thats why establishing a structure and architecture for deciding and effective communication is vital. here, smaller cross-functional teams are helpful, each with a transparent mission and reporting line, where directions and tasks are easy to implement. this also simplifies onboarding new hires, who can integrate faster in a very tight-knit group, at a time when the broad sweep of the organization isnt visible or easy to feel. with fewer in each team, theres longer to urge to understand one another and build the trust that will grow more organically within the office. at ping an insurance, workers are typically grouped in project teams of, at most, 30 members, while larger business units are divided to assist them to stay agile. strong company-wide foundations underpin this, like having a typical purpose and unified goals. providing clarity on what decisions to escalate and which of them is tackled at the team level helps drive progress. to mitigate the consequences of closed retail stores, one leading fashion company founded a technique room and redeployed staff into four cross-functional squads to support its front-line. it designed standard ways for live broadcasting and established internal best practices to encourage front-line staff to use new retail tools to drive sales remotely.the lesson: putting in small, cross-functional teams with clear objectives and a typical purpose keeps everyone on the identical strategic course.leading from afar due to impacts of covid-19 on the world of workmanaging people is one of the foremost difficult elements of remote working, not least because everyone will respond differently to the cultural shift and challenges of the home-working environment. leaders have to energize the entire company by setting a transparent direction and communicating it effectively. offering a powerful vision and a sensible outlook can have a strong effect on motivation across the organization. its essential to foster an outcome-driven culture that empowers and holds teams answerable for getting things done while encouraging open, honest, and productive communication. empowering your team in this way pays dividends.wesure, a part of leading internet company tencent, assembled a covid-19 response team5 at the beginning of the year to supply amount, freed from charge to front-line medical workers.alan lau, ceo of wesure, credited his team, saying that they had worked nonstop, many from remote locations while inactive during the chinese new year break, demonstrating how responsive they were to the vision.for managers, the challenge is to guide, inspire, and direct their team in their daily course of labor, while being physically remote. upping the amount of interaction can even work well here. one chief information officer, responding to a mckinsey survey, said hes texting the whole company with regular updates because its a more human way of communicating than via the official corporate channels. when working within distributed teams, e-commerce giant alibaba increases the frequency of its one-to-one communications with employees to a weekly basis and, in some teams, members submit a weekly report for his or her colleagues, complete with plans for the week ahead. alibabas productivity app dingtalk (ding ding) has features inbuilt to facilitate this by allowing managers to send voice-to-text messages to their teams, and to test in on progress.the lesson: determining how you communicate is simply as important as whats being said, and it has to be done confidently, consistently, and reliablyinstilling a caring cultureas companies transition to the new normal, its important to acknowledge that some employees are also facing other pressures reception, including caring for his or her children when schools are shut, resulting in feelings of isolation and insecurity. business leaders must respect and address these additional needs. empathy may be a crucial tool here, offering how to attach, promote inclusiveness, and make a way of community in a very barren of physical interaction. increasing social interactions within the team, particularly through one-on-one catch-up, guards against feelings of isolation and demoralization and creates space for people to talk up and share their thoughts. by creating a way of psychological safety for his or her colleagues, being inclusive in deciding, and offering perspective in challenging moments, managers can stay closer to whats occurring, surface issues, and help their teams solve problems effectively. a similar approach is very important when coping with customers and clients, providing valuable stability and enabling them to navigate unknown waters confidently. as an example, one global bank asked their relationship managers to attach with small-business customers via wechat and video calls to know their situation and help them weather the crisis. to try and do so effectively at scale, the managers are supported through dedicated product programs, online articles, scripts for communicating with clients, and internal training. inclusion is that the ultimate show of empathy. creating outlets for sharing best practices, success stories, challenges, and water-cooler chat are significant to making a persons connection. giving employees space to pursue personal or social endeavors, providing a transparent span of control, and assigning meaningful tasks also can spur motivation.the lesson: connecting on a private level and instilling empathy within the culture is doubly important when working remotely.finding a new routinemoving to remote working risks disrupting the office-based flows and rhythms and it will be easy to hit the incorrect note or miss important virtual meetings thanks to packed schedules. spend time along with your team addressing the nuts and bolts of how youll work together. cover the daily rhythm, individual constraints, and specific norms youll decide to and anticipate what might get it wrong and the way youll mitigate it. how companies plan and review their workflows has to change to reflect this. the challenges of the new working pattern and of not being in one room together will be overcome by creating a digitally facilitated cadence of meetings.one leading insurance firm adopted agile practices across its teams, with a daily and weekly ritual of check-ins, sprint planning, and review sessions. as alibaba embraced remote working, it also made sure its meetings were more tightly run. one person is assigned to trace time and manage the outcomes. team members can rate a meetings usefulness by employing a five-star system that gives immediate feedback and positive ways forward. to address the challenge of launching a digital business with an oversized remote team, one company created a replacement workflow for product requirements that clearly outlined the use of digital tools, roles, and responsibilities as requirements moved from ideation to validation to delivery stages. reiteration of decision-making structures like this isnt always necessary when people can communicate directly, but their absence will be keenly felt when remote working kicks in.
the lesson: establishing robust working norms, workflows, and features of authority is critical, but only too easy to stint on. adopting a test and learn the strategy the final lesson: being able to recognize what isnt working and changing it fast.
these are the impacts of covid-19 on the world of work. leadership teams that continuously learn actively identify best practices, and rapidly founded mechanisms to share ideas across the organization tend to be most successful within the future. r&d teams at one leading high-tech manufacturer created a productivity target for remote work by estimating their productivity hebdomadally relative to onsite work and identifying levers to enhance it. within four weeks, they had progressed from 50 percent to 88 percent of their baseline. as chinas workforce begins to return to offices, these lessons from a number of its leading companies help as an example of howwith the correct structure, culture, processes, and technologyworking remotely can boost productivity and morale. employees who spend less time traveling or commuting and have a much better work-life balance are likely to be happier, more motivated, and prepared to mobilize in extreme situations. embracing remote working allows companies to define a brand new normal that drives productivity and employee satisfaction into the longer term. alibaba launched taobao, by now the worlds biggest e-commerce website, while the staff was working remotely on quarantine during the 2003 sars outbreak. for trip.com, an overseas working experiment in 20147 established the foundations for nice customer service and versatile working culture. hence, bringing together all the weather can enable a brand new way of working that may make your company suited the futurewhatever which will hold. these are policies that will mitigate the impacts of covid-19 on the world of work

the british ruled india, many indians
accepted to work under their policy, and they did not try to rebel against the british for
their presence in indian lands; they recognized the benefits of british rule. what
was the factor that made indians accept the
british government? the perception about
british-policies (about trading, pay-scale, and positioning in the military) had been
done through various marketing channels in such a way that it brainwashed people of the nation, and many were ready to accept the british. so the marketing is like fire when smartly
handled; it can destroy your enemies, but when not it can burn you. marketing is to design and develop a pathway from product or service to the customer through a product, price, place and promotion strategies. marketing depends on a variety of parameters that can be classified broadly, boiling down to vital three. these are what type of customer are marketing team is focusing on (based on gender, age, location, customer-class) (w1), what are product specification or applications you need to bring in front of customer (w2), what is your product promotion flow path (w3), how much time it takes to convey product information to customer (h1). these criteria are what i call 3w1h forms. these basics need to be taken care of while developing a marketing strategy for the upcoming product. however, are they enough? no. there is one more parameter called the feedback mechanism (fm). generally, machines use the feedback mechanism to check output generated is as per input is given or not and if it is not, the input is corrected to get the required output. when it comes to human beings, he/she is surrounded by multiple products daily through social media, tv advertising and so forth. slight uncertainties on either side in observation can make a positive or negative impact on the product on the consumers mind. in the feedback mechanism, the marketing team needs to answer only one question what kind of product image built in the customer mind through promotional activities? if the product image not built as per expectation, then management has to review and work on 3w1h, as discussed earlier. so lets elaborate how 3w1h approach works along with feedback mechanism. fig.1- 3w1h with fm process can target customer effectively after deciding the customer range, you can work on other
activities. since the customer is
conscious about purchasing the product and
when the product promoted, the first thing the customer will check is its
usefulness, and if his/her answer is yes,
then the customer will start comparing with similar alternative products in the
market. therefore, one should present the
product along with some unique thought
and express the product in such a way that its image imprinted into the consumer
mind. for example, the polio campaign in
india. the government had taken the initiative to make india polio-free by
spreading awareness through all types of social communication mediums, in which
television played a vital role. legendary
cinema actor amitabh bachchan was selected as an ambassador for this campaign.
initially, the advertisement published in which amitabh pleaded people for vaccinating
the children within a fixed schedule. the advertisement circulated throughout the nation, and
no stone was kept unturned by the government
to make this campaign successful. however,
much to the surprise, advertising failed miserably to attract a deprived community in polio booth. this promotion failure was because of
non-consideration of the customer (w1)
and how advertise impacted its application on the customer (w2)? so after analysing failure, experts recommended changes
in their marketing campaign like, to focus on major customer (here mainly
village woman who generally spend their time in home by watching tv), type of
impact on people (people who watched tv during that era, had an image of
amitabh as angry young man). so the campaign
improved their advertising by bringing out the same angry amitabh instead of
his soft-image, which used in the earlier campaign. so in a very next polio
campaign number of people in the polio booth suddenly increased and when
feedback is taken from people about such a sudden change, they replied that we
dont want to watch amitabh sir getting angry because of us.[i]in
w3, organisation must focus on what kind of channel use to attract the customer. currently,
there are a lot of platforms available by
which you can market your product. the main
agenda you should keep in mind is that how effectively you can engage the customer
through marketing, at very first, if you make an
impact on customer then only, he can show interest in your product. for
example, changes in launching trailers of
the upcoming films. till 20th
century television and newspaper were crucial
factors, but now along with television, marketing team take help of internet
resources like youtube, facebook,
introducing an article on the pre-trailer phenomenon. increasing the range of promotional devices, broadcast formats and publishing platforms provide a broad range to promote the film and choosing right platform may lead to a massive hit in the box-office. for
the last factor (h1) time, the obvious question that comes to mind is that is time for advertising matters?, while
watching the tv when an advertisement appears,
many times we change the channel instead of
watching the whole ad or ignore it altogether. you do have an option of skip ad when you watch anything online, so one must decide how much time is required
to deliver product information during its
promotion? delivering product information
in less time, may create the possibility that the customer will watch it so it
can result in attracting more customers. so, the content will be the
king in the marketing. however, as one
must have guessed it, this will not work all the time. other factors like the cost of the product,
application range, type of customer can also affect
the h1. for example, the customer would be
more conscious while watching higher-priced
product broadcast compare to the lower-priced one. so it would take more time
for the marketing team to convince the
customer to buy the expensive good than the lower-priced one.after
implementing a marketing strategy as per 3w1h, we need to work on a feedback mechanism in which organization has to collect information about
product image generated in customers minds through dealers and using feedback-form. not using the feedback mechanism may lead to failure in achieving
product sales target and can make the situation even worse. take the example of the tata nano-making of worlds
cheapest car, which was mind-blowing one-of-a-kind projects in indian
automobile industry. from the first phase of a marketing
campaign, tata nano was on so much
continuous limelight that this project was pleased by former american president
barack obama.[ii]
the curiosity about the product
was so high that the sale of then-leading
car model maruti-800 was dropped by 20% immediately after unveiling the nano.[iii]
however, while marketing the product, an organization built affordable, garibo ki car image in customers mind,
which made customers conscious about what will be their status-quo in society
after buying nano? thus, they started giving preference to two-wheelers over nano. during the same time, some instances of nanos catching fire came
into focus, which worsened the situation.
this case even exacerbates when the team
did not work on the feedback mechanism
and hence, was not able to change customer
perception about nano. later, when nano fire problem was technically sorted out
but even then, the marketing team did not
make any impactful effort to market the improved safety of the car. therefore, customers negative perception
remained stuck and the organization did
not even come close to achieving selling
figures of nano. if the organization had used
feedback mechanism, it would have been an entirely different story. so
3w1h can be an essential factor while
developing a marketing strategy for the
product along with a reversible fm
method. this method can help us to
monitor product marketing throughout the phases and can help the marketing team to
change strategy whenever it goes into the wrong
path.[i] [iii] ","['british', 'ruled', 'india', 'many', 'indian', 'accepted', 'work', 'policy', 'try', 'rebel', 'british', 'presence', 'indian', 'land', 'recognized', 'benefit', 'british', 'rule',

49,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/continued-demand-for-sustainability/,Continued Demand for Sustainability - Blackcoffer Insights,"the business of business is no longer to do just business
or increase the bottom line to maximize shareholder value. rather, the concept
of business is moving towards a new dimension of sustainable business, the
triple bottom line. people, planet, and profits are the core
ideologies that are rooted in sustainable business. sustainability is taken
into account when companies want to create long-term value creation along with
strategies that promote the longevity of the company. as corporate
accountability rises, expectations and need for transparency among stakeholders
increases therefore companies have started to recognize the need to be
sustainable to stay alert and alive. business
globalization that has happened over the previous few decades has made some
companies more powerful than some national governments, making it easy for them
to exploit inexpensive labor, plunder natural resources, causing severe impacts
through pollution on the natural environment, human health, and biodiversity.
unfortunately for them, their horrible past has been catching up with them like
in the case of child labor issues of ikea & nike, rana plaza accident in
bangladesh affecting zara, h&m and other clothing brands, environment
pollution by bp, shell, exxon mobil etc. with the emergence of internet and
social media these practices can no longer be covered up and silenced, the
world has become more educated and less tolerant and therefore with every
misdemeanor that is committed brand equity takes a hit. the media is fast
picking up on cover-ups, half-truths, and bad corporate behavior and demanding
accountability and transparency from corporates. therefore to survive, companies
are compelled to adopt sustainability and bring forth the rules for their
suppliers as well. many
of the irresponsible company practices and disasters that are witnessed in that
last couple of decades were motivated solely by short-termism- the desire
for instant gratification- and the appeal of short-term performance
incentives. for instance, deferred maintenance and slack leadership were to
blame for the 1984 leaks from the pesticide plant union carbide india ltd in
bhopal. estimates placed more than half a million casualties from the gas
discharge of the plant. finally, union carbide corporations 1989 litigation
payout came out to todays equivalent of nearly one billion us dollars. another
example where the company was forced to shut down operations was coca cola at
its plachimada plant in kerala. the local communities faced acute water
shortage after the commissioning of the plant and the company authorities
blatantly ignored the community woes. these businesses stated above didnt
respect stakeholder engagement which ultimately lead to their untimely demise.todays
issues cannot be solved without participation from all stakeholders, and
companies with influence should be the torchbearers of change. they need to
engage with regulators, communities, societies, suppliers, and ngos for
effective and desired outcomes. issues where engagement are required include
population growth; global middle-class growth; decline in ecosystems; water
scarcity; food safety; material resource security; higher global energy demand;
changes in geographic patterns of energy consumption; and increasing climate
change regulatory interventions.by actively pursuing the triple
bottom line, the essential possibilities available are:save expenses
by reducing environmental effects; motivate
employees and decreased employee turnover;decrease risk
through engaging with stakeholders; create a
reputation by improving environmental effectiveness ;in order for companies to commit
to sustainability they should have the below objectives in place:strategy alignment and sustainability: management should ensure alignment between the companys strategy and its sustainability initiatives. sometimes, there is a divergence between the two concepts making sustainability attempts to look fragile and lacking real dedication and prioritization. for example, toyota is well known for hybrid engine development, but less so for decreasing its reliance on rare earth minerals. toyota decreased its dependence on imports and operational risk, thus reducing its economic hazards in the event of price rises.compliance first, then competitive advantage: compliance must be addressed first and foremost by businesses, which often involves laws on waste management, pollution, and energy efficiency as well as human rights and labor accountability. recent reports show that investors are shying away from compliance hazards progressively. reactive to proactive: as a result of a crisis, many of todays leading sustainability businesses such as nike, coca-cola, telenor, ikea, siemens, and nestl have stepped up mainly. for instance, in locations like indonesia throughout the 90s, nike confronted boycotts and government anger for abusive labor practices but turned the tide around. it became a pioneer in the establishment of transparency in 2005 by releasing a full list of the factories with which it contracts and a comprehensive 108-page report revealing conditions and payment in its factories. it also recognized huge problems, especially in its factories in south asia. these businesses have all created more proactive sustainability approaches by acknowledging the effect of sustainability in a crisis.quantify,
including the company situation:
all businesses are struggling to quantify their sustainability investment
returns. this is a straightforward problem with respect to compliance. transparency
is a precondition for assessing and enhancing sustainability practices. the only way for companies to achieve transparency is through
open communication with all key stakeholders based on high levels of
information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy as well as an openness to
recognize faults and improve practices.sustainability -triple bottom line- can drive a companys achievement beyond shareholder value creation by building corporate shared value at its core and help in addressing social &environmental problems. several investors today use esg metrics to evaluate the ethical effect and sustainability practices of an organization. investors are looking at variables like the carbon footprint of a company, water use, community development efforts, and diversity board before investing. companies have started responding to investors by publishing their annual sustainability reports. research indicates that businesses with elevated esg scores have reduced debt and equity costs and that sustainability projects can contribute to improving economic efficiency while encouraging government assistance. its only a matter of time, the flow of sustainability nourishes businesses in achieving holistic development for the environment, people and its profits.blackcoffer insights 12 | ","['business', 'business', 'longer', 'business', 'increase', 'bottom', 'line', 'maximize', 'shareholder', 'value', 'rather', 'concept', 'business', 'moving',

do social media provide solace or grounds for misinformation, (de)humanization, and discrimination? can we harness the flexibility and ubiquity of media technologies to increase the publics adherence to the safety measures suggested by global health organizations to combat the spread of covid-19?

as humanitarian disaster from covid-19. india is facing economic pressure due to the coronavirus outbreak. this outbreak has resulted in a steep slowdown in the indian economy, whereby indias gdp has reduced by 4.5% as seen by current statistics. with covid-19 being into the picture the indian economy is going through a severe slowdown and on top of that multiple such problems hitting the world of work from many such directions. companies and industries are finding it difficult to sustain in such an environment of the financial crisis. industries are being urged to take up certain tough decisions like layoff, retrenchment, compulsive leave without pay and many alternative cost-effective methods to sustain the present economic crisis like cutting down the salaries, handing over the pink slip to employees and opting best possible. the sudden outbreak has presented new roadblocks for the indian workforce and especially for the daily wage and contractual workers.according to the latest economy forecast by the un, the probability of countries entering into the recession and companies going bankrupt has increased and india is not likely to remain decoupled from the global meltdown. lockdown across the country is causing significant disruption across multiple sectors including manufacturing, tourism, aviation, real estate, etc are the worst affected. temporary lockdown resulting in the closing of shopping malls, has affected the indian economy in a disastrous manner, adversely as a result of which consumption of essential items has reduced which in turn has given a terrible blow to the retail sector. according to the statistics from the economic times of india, live event industries have seen an estimated loss of 3000 crores. a number of young startups have been affected as the funding has fallen and there would be a lack of investors in the market. the disruption of the economy is much starker and alarming than the global financial crisis of 2008, which hit the indian financial sector. besides that back in 2008 the indian economy was much better placed to handle the crisis. according to the data in 2019 the gst collection was expected to be approximately 7.4 lakh crore while the government was only able to collect a total of 5.8 lakh crore that is a total loss of 1.6 lakh crore, the government also faced a setback in the income tax sector as the expected revenue to be collected was estimated to 5.2 lakh crore but the government faced a shortfall of 50,000 crores. the above discrepancies have resulted in insufficient funds with the government clearly the government does not have sufficient funds to provide relief to the people mainly the labor class, contractual workers and the people working on the basis of daily wages. other major industries whose figures of losses are alarming are the hospitality and tourism industry which employs approx. 4 crore people. in the next 10-12 months it expects 12 lakh job losses which may act as a major factor in revenue lo and revenue losses of 11,000 crores. the aviation industry is worth 2.2 lakh crore, employing 3.5 lakh people, they expect a revenue loss of 4,200 crores just between april and june. indias retail industry is the total worth of 59 lakh crore employing around 4.6 crore people, if the pandemic crisis lasts 3 months further it expects 1.1 crore job losses. the restaurant industry employs 73 people, of whom 14%-15% may probably lose their job. the real estate industry is looking at an approximate 35%-40% job loss. ride-hailing industries meaning ola and uber have approximately 5 million driver-partners, the crisis has led to a drop of 40%-50% in the business. these figures would get even more disturbing in the next few weeks as the country heads into total lockdown. top car manufacturers like honda, hyundai have shut down their car productions. many other such companies have shut down their production until further notice. this would again lead to more lay-offs. the stock market in india has also seen a breakdown since the lockdown quarantine and lockdowns have disrupted the chain supply across the whole world. as the trade between the countries has come to a halt, it has affected the global economy as well as the countrys gdp. while some industries in india depend on other countries for their raw material, for example the electronics market, it depends on china majorly for its raw material, has seen a major setback as trade between the two countries trade has been seized. the outbreak of the virus has placed tremendous responsibility in the hands of the government. the reserve bank of india (rbi) along with the government intends to implement below-mentioned measures to deal with the looming economic crisis such as: the government under their jan dhan yojana has opened 38 crore bank accounts that aim to make affordable access to financial services for the poorest population of india, even a direct transfer 5000 can reduce the distress of the poor immediately. interest-free or low-interest bank loans must be provided for medium, small and micro enterprises for the next 4-5 months, which could give an immediate boost for the economy. lowering tax to stimulate demand and place more money in the hands of the people and businesses is vital.rbi has provided 3 months moratorium would lessen the financial stress of the public at large an economic response task force was
announced on 19 march 2020, led by the finance minister of india nirmala sitharaman,
to tackle the financial crisis. as of announced on march 26, a $ 23 billion dollar package for fighting the
economic pandemic has been sanctioned. the spending proposed in the package
would amount to about 0.5% of the estimated gdp, while the other countries have
a package of about 4%-5% of its gdp.everywhere in the world, governments are recognizing that this is no time to worry about fiscal deficits. instead, they have to do whatever it takes to come out of this extraordinary crisis. immediate and necessary actions are indispensable not only from the indian government but also from every individual to prevent this health pandemic from turning furthermore into an even greater economic disaster.

corona outbreak has hit us hard. with the world economy suddenly coming to a
standstill, the future seems more uncertain. the pandemic has shown its worst
effect in the developed countries most. the following figure depicts the most affected countries as of march 31, 2020- (source: who)however,
the cases in india are still low, with total active cases under 1,500 as of 1st
april 2020, but the low number of tests performed remains a big issue of
concern.the
following map shows the affected states in india (source: ministry of health
and family welfare)the
number may seem small, but if we closely have a look at the daily cases
reported, then the situation seems more alarming with the growth looking more
of exponential now. the
number of cases no doubt are soon going to increase in the future, which is
hard to predict right now. but the curve is expected to be flatter in case of
india, as the lesson has been learnt from mistakes of countries like italy and
a nation has been kept under a lockdown.this was a necessary step, no doubt, but it has raised
more problems for an already slowdown hit country.the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry (ficci) said: a significant 53 percent of indian businesses indicate the marked impact of the coronavirus pandemic on business operations even at early stages. the tourism and travel industry has been hit most whose operations have almost come down to zero. the second most hit sector is manufacturing, and with a significant portion of the unorganized sector being employed there, the situation worsens. healthcare and hygiene products like mouth masks, sanitizers, and handwash have become expensive due to excessive demand.with the present ongoing situation, the followings
things can be predicted:the medicines and healthcare costs are expected to increase in the future as india imports 69% of the raw material of pharmaceutical drugs, and due to lockdown in both countries, the supply route has been fragmented drastically. this is also evident with the recent increase in common use medicines like paracetamol, whose cost has gone up by 40% as per the latest crisil report.industries depending on cheap labor could take a hit as such pandemics are more prone to populated countries, and the factory workers and unorganized sectors dont have access to healthcare benefits, so the cases might just shoot up drastically, and their attendance in the future will go down in the same rate inversely.smartphones and electronics sales will be affected directly. in china the sale of smartphones is expected to go down by 50%, as stores are in lockdown for a long time, new launch events are getting postponed or canceled, and since china is the largest smartphone manufacturer in the world, with 1 out of every 4 smartphones shipped from china, this will affect us too. similar is the case with electronics, whose parts and even whole units in many cases are manufactured by china. so their prices might rise in the future, maybe not immediately, but in the last quarter of the financial year.lack of technology will incur a greater logistic cost of containing the coronavirus outbreaks in the case of india. china being the technology giant, took the help of technology to track and contain the coronavirus outbreak, but in our case where more than 80% of transactions are by hand, the cost and risk of containing the virus will be very high.the meat prices are dropping drastically due to stigma with losses reaching more than 1100 crores. this is an issue of serious concern for a country like india whose meat industry is 90% governed by the unorganized sector.the sectors which are going to get some serious hit are- airlines, tourism & travel, cruise, share market, leisure & hospitality, automobiles, and product manufacturers due to negative sentiments and fear in the minds of common people.the sectors which will need to prove themselves are- banking, education, healthcare and manufacturing. a lot will depend on how they will react in the future.the
indian economy could react to corona crisis in 3 ways:v-shaped: this is classic real economy shock, where output does get displaced, but growth eventually recovers. in this scenario, annual growth rates could fully absorb the shock. this was the case with the canada post-2008 crisis where canada maintained the credit flow and capital formation.u-shaped: this scenario is worse than v the shock persists, and even though the initial growth is resumed but there is some permanent loss of output. this was the case with the usa post-2008 crisis. this was led by a deep banking crisis that disturbed credit supply.l-shaped: this scenario is worst of all. not only the growth rate declines, but the economy never recovers. the distance between the previous and new path keeps on widening with increased loss of output, leaving lasting structural damage to the economy. with the recent cut of indias growth projections by moodys and fitch, the future indicates a deeper slowdown, if not recession. to come out of this pandemic cleanly and with lesser shocks, the government needs to set its priorities right- with prime focus right now on the medical and healthcare sector as the country is battling against the coronavirus, but along with that, the government should try to take along the lower sections of the society providing them monetary gains as they are the one who is battling with the daily necessities along with the virus. in the long term, the government should keep an eye on the issue of liquidity to keep the cycle going. but above all this, we as a responsible citizen should
understand our duties and responsibilities towards the country and society and
try to take our country out of this outbreak by doing our part. blackcoffer insights 16:- shubham joshi, university business school, chandigarh ","['corona', 'outbreak', 'hit', 'u', 'hard', 'world',

58,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/impact-of-covid-19coronavirus-on-the-indian-economy/,Impact of Indian Economy due to COVID-19 - Blackcoffer Insights,"covid-19: introductionthe novel coronavirus (covid-19),
initially emerged in china at the end of 2019 and by the end of january
2020, the world health organization declared this pandemic as a public health
emergency of international concern. this virus
causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever,
and in more severe cases, difficulty in breathing or may cause lung disease.
senior citizens or people under some medical treatment are more likely to
acclimate to this virus.the impact of this
outbreak is rapidly increasing at a higher rate than anything else in the
economies of various countries of the world. this outbreak is considered a
situation like recession or slowdown of the overall economy after the great
recession in the year 2008.india is the
fifth-largest economy in the world with a population of 133.92 crores. india is
still in its developing phase and its uneven development across regions and
communities adds various complexities in coping up with this kind of pandemic.
it also reflects that there is a huge scope for social schism among the people
of different communities.in india, the first
case was reported at the end of january month because people travel from china
to india. the government of india made special arrangements for the students
and people who were there in wuhan for studies and work so that india can save
their people from the effect of this novel coronavirus. the infection rate of
this virus is relatively low in india as compared to its population size
because of the rapid actions taken by the government to quarantine people and
shut borders.also, the government
of india announces the suspension of various activities in the country like
shut down of educational institutes and corporate houses, deferring all tourist
visas and postal services, cease all the interstate and intrastate borders
within the country, and terminate all the transportation facilities. the drive
of social distancing and isolation of infected people also takes place.the initiatives taken
by the government of india in accordance with this pandemic outbreak affect the
economy in a very drastic way. it changes the way in which the country is
developing. a lot of disruption is happening all around the nation which
challenges the unimaginably ambitious aim of the modi government for
achieving $5 trillion economy by 2024.covid-19: economic impactthe indian economy is
deemed as the fastest developing economies in the world. india has now emerged
as a global preeminent player in the worlds economies and at the third-largest
economy in terms of purchasing power parity. it consists of numerous sectors or
channels such as hospitality, education, retail, e-commerce, aviation,
petroleum, banking, automobiles, pharma or healthcare, insurance, and railways,
etc. which are going unfavourably influenced by this disruption and through
which the economy is getting affected.covid-19: hospitalitythe hotel industry of india has a very vast contribution towards indias total gross domestic product. it is the most prominent service sector with market size of $22 billion in 2019 & the proposed rate of growth by 8.6% till 2025 now becomes a challenge because of this pandemic. the intact turnover of the indian hospitality sector was sunk between $8.85 billion to $10 billion which reflects depletion of 39% 45% as correlated to last years revenues. the hospitality sector needs to take proactive financial steps to mitigate the impact of covid 19. it is wholly based on travel, trade, and tourism for its subsistence or existence. this extensive outbreak leads to huge cancellations of bookings in the last months leads to the miserable position of hotels in the worrisome declines.hotels are
grappling from crisis amid stringent government restrictions and also
emphasizing on isolation and social distancing. the impact is very huge and is
unpredictable but the sector is at its maturity level and focusing on their
hospitality commitment to and for the society in the best way they can. the big
hotel chains in india propose their rooms and venues for free of cost or at
very highly subsidized rates to the government for the purpose of quarantine
people who came back from abroad and to the medical fraternity to use rooms as
the isolation infirmaries. also, the pantries are used for preparing feeds for
the needy ones in a proper sanitized manner.the industry
professionals have to keep an eye on their rivals to check their surviving
policies at this consequence and they have to sustain their public image in the
market after analysing the after-effects on their pricing and preservation of
their assets. this industry may exceed after witnessing remarkable assurance in
the economy.covid-19: educationeducation is a pretty essential aspect
in an underdeveloped country like india. indias education sector proposes a
glorious opportunity to 29% of indias population which is between the ages of
0-14 years. there is a foreseen rise in indias higher education sector of rs
2,44,824 crore by 2025 but as the occurrence of the virus thats a troublesome
challenge. the covid-19 outbreak has set off alarm
bells across the country for the 250 million school going students along with
students enrolled in universities in india. indias education sector is not
unaffected, it has given shut down of school, colleges and other institutions
this is basically for social distancing to prevent the cause-effect of the
spreading virus and be precaution beforehand of the disruption. india has
resulted in 49.86% of the increase in internet penetration utilized to remit
learning. so to permeate the pauses the virtual classes and online classes are
catching the drift i.e. a merge turn to the digital learning platform.in the wake of this dilemma and
gripping the student safety in mind and their scholarly concern, most of the
institutes have taken the action to accommodate the convenience of
telecommunication, skype call, zoom call and admittance to other virtual
prospects to fill the gap of learning. the examinations are being suspended or
postponed keeping the concerns of the burgeoning covid-19 on the masses
extensively in the consultation.undoubtedly, this is a very crucial
time for students. ironically, it has taken the covid-19 outbreak to get the
whole education sector to slip to digital mode and with both humanistic and
technological support. the impact on education is likely to induce losses in
terms of dropout rates and learning outcomes, especially in regions with low shock
resilience.covid-19: travel & tourismthe coronavirus outbreak had a
debilitating influence on indias travel and tourism sector with the industry
assessing an overall deterioration of 5 lakh crore with witnessing a 4-5
crore people job cuts. it was also scrutinized that online travel agencies were
set to suffer as much as 4,312 crores, tour operators (inbound and
domestic) 25,000 crores, adventure tour operators nearly 19,000 crores and
cruise tourism 419 crores. this sector engages employment to the extensive
segment of the civilization like miniature homestays and regular wage
earners.the time period from december to may is
very crucial and important for this sector to attract its customers as people
come from outside the country in this time span and also people within the
country travel a lot to spend their summer holidays and also the people who
travel abroad. according to icc, foreign tourist arrivals (fta) has got fluff
by about 67% seasonally in january-march, while for domestic tourists, the
value is lower by almost 40%.according to the world economic forum
(wef), this pandemic is putting up to 50 million jobs in the global travel and
tourism sector at risk and out of this, around 30 million would be in asia.
indian chamber of commerce (icc) counsels fixing up of a travel & tourism
stabilisation fund with direct gain transfer to each unit to prevent
commercial loss and sequential job loss. it is presumed that it would take up
to 10 months for the tourism sector to get back to its sustainable level.travel and tourism sector bodies had
communicated to the government for interim aid to pay emis, instalments, taxes,
and salaries to operators as the tourism industry is eyeing destitution,
cessation of industries and mass lay-off. the unskilled people of the industry
are perceived as the most vulnerable link in the whole industry concatenation.covid-19: banking & financialthe indian banking sector has an
influential pivotal role in the development of an economy as it is considered a
necessary service sector in society. indias banking sector is sufficiently
capitalized and well regulated by the regulatory body the reserve bank of india
(rbi). currently, indian banking and financial industry is at the fifth-largest
in the world and has the potential to become third-largest by 2024 and
contributing approx 7.7% towards the gdp of india. although the banking and
financial sector were previously suffering a lot and are on the struggling
plank because of scams like nirav modi, vuca disruptions like demonetization,
the enlightenment of gst in the nation and now with this pandemic.this disruption causes so many problems
to the retail as well as corporate customers. indian banking association, said
to bank customers that they should visit the bank branches only in the
situation of extreme emergency. the bank branch cut-offs the working hours in a
day. many branches were sanitized under the orders of the state government and
the services are kept limited which are most essential in the branches. rbi
asked customers to use digital platforms for most of the operations and banks
are operating round-the-clock to assure all digital channels are up to date.however, an appropriate fiscal policy
response should be implemented to uplift the economy from drowsiness to a
vigorous state. from boosting banks liquidity to providing financial relief to
its customers, rbi announced various guidelines to stabilize the concern of
corporate houses as well as msmes and retail customers in the wake of this
outbreak.banks are now being allowed for a three
months moratorium on payment of instalments regarding all term loans prominent
as on 01.03.2020. also, the repayment schedule and tenure of such loans can be
shifted by 3 months. further to tackle financially this industry and its
valuable customers the rbi also slashed the repo rate by 75 basis points.covid-19: conclusionthe government of india mobilized various committees or task force specifically for covid-19 and national disaster management authority (ndma)to overcome from this pandemic. these committees are here to ensure a harmonized response against this outbreak. the government took all necessary steps to fight against the coronavirus such as introducing a new app for the population named as aarogya setu app which gives essential information about the virus. such crises also heal the earth back to its natural state with fewer disruptions by humans. it could also be stated that such crises also seed some opportunities in the nation for the better development of the whole economy.blackcoffer insights

is spread to humans? how coronavirus affects the world economy? several
questions come in mind when we talk about the coronavirus.coronavirus disease (covid-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. these are a type of virus that creates sickness in humans. there are many different kinds, and some cause disease. a newly identified type has caused a recent outbreak of respiratory illness now called covid-19.the covid-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. coronaviruses vary significantly in the risk factors. some can kill more than 30% of those infected and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold. coronaviruses cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids, occurring primarily in the winter and early spring seasons.as it creates much chaos between humans and also affected the whole human diversity, it also creates a disturbance in the economy. the economy is the largest system of trade and industry by which the wealth of a country is made and used. if this economy will not work then the human race will also come to an end. so not only covid-19 makes the humans sick but also it makes the economy a viral whole. the impact of coronavirus firstly affects economic growth which is the factor that creates nation wealth. economic growth creates wealth on a national scale for the government in the form of taxation, which is then redistributed accordingly to the services and communities that need it the most. due to covid-19 industrial production, sales and investment all fell in the first two months of the year which decline the whole economic growth. such a slowdown in manufacturing industries has hurt countries that are interlinked to each other in terms of exports i.e. asia pacific economies, sub-saharan economies and the usa economies. a reduction in global economic activity has lowered the demand for oil, taking oil prices to multi-year lows. this happens even before a disagreement on production cuts between opec and its allies caused the plunge in oil prices.job creation and employment opportunities are the second most factor which was affected by coronavirus as it often requires the skills and some wilful hands which necessitate in the long term of the business. longer lasting and more intensive outbreak have half growth the opportunities in 2020 as factories suspend their activity and workers stay at home to try to avoid the virus.poverty is the third and most important factor which is diversely affected by covid-19 as employment is not there and everyone was ordered to stay at home. when people will be in their own houses then automatically poverty will increase complimenting the decrease in economic growth.there is also a big shift in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, affected many investments by the investors and shareholders or individual savings accounts. central banks in many countries, including india, have slashed interest rates. supermarkets and online delivery services also have huge growth in demand as customers stockpile goods such as hand sanitizers, toilet paper, rice, and orange juice etc.as the pandemic escalates.at last the covid-19 normally called coronavirus affects the world economy in a much-disintegrated manner. some economies in which there are many deaths due to coronavirus will take more time to recover as their economy has gone before 2 years back. the economy can only be revived if the government makes more strict measures and coronavirus can be cured by the vaccine.blackcoffer insights 16:-aman maini, chanderprabhu jain college of higherstudie and school of law ","['coronavirus', 'disease', 'spread', 'human', 'coronavirus', 'affect', 'world',

60,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/ensuring-growth-through-insurance-technology/,Ensuring growth through Insurance Technology - Blackcoffer Insights,"the generally accepted
solution to economies stagnating under inefficient and resource sapping state-run
monopolies is liberalization. china under the leadership of deng xiaoping did
it in 1978 after witnessing their economic growth falter and surpassed by their
asian rivals japan and south korea. india did the same in 1991 after being
backed into a corner by the balance of payments crisis. the telecom industry in
india was one of the many sectors subject to reform, and the privatization of
this industry meant that the total number of subscribers shot up from 37
million in the year 2001 to over 1.13 billion subscribers in 2018. this also
allowed reliance jio in 2016 to disrupt the industry by initiating a price war,
which led to a significant decrease in mobile usage tariffs and large-scale
consolidation of telecom giants, the benefits of which the consumers are
reaping. the stability of this approach in the long term is still under
question; however, it cannot be denied that this change has brought access to
unprecedented amounts of data to people for whom it was impossible to get
without a significant financial outlay.in a country where despite having close to 18% of the world population at the start of the millennium, its global share in the life insurance market was only 0.49%, a similar change was necessary for bringing insurance coverage to the most vulnerable and underrepresented sections of society. the insurance market was opened up in august 2000 by the then recently formed insurance regulatory and development authority (irdai), and 18 years on there has been a noticeable change. according to a research publication by swiss re, life insurance penetration, which is the ratio of total life insurance premium underwritten to the gdp of the country, has come up from 2.15% in 2001 to 2.76% in 2017, hitting a peak of 4.60% in 2009. the drop-in insurance penetration is attributed to lesser consumer spending in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and not a systemic issue with the indian insurance market. life insurance density or life insurance is underwritten per capita, has increased six times from usd 9.10 in 2001 to usd 55 in 2017. however, the global average insurance penetration rate, including both life and non-life insurance stands at 6.13% compared to indias 3.69%. some of our asian neighbors, such as thailand (5.29%), china (4.57%) and malaysia (4.77%) to have outdone us in this regard. their insurance density is also far superior; the figures for malaysia, thailand and china during the same period i.e. 2016 were usd 486, usd 348 and usd 384 respectively compared to usd 73 for india.like india, these countries have an open insurance market where foreign firms are allowed to enter and impart funds and technological expertise. however, the challenges and nuances that are involved in ensuring greater coverage and access to information for indian citizens are far different than the ones there. as of 2010, only 7.5% of the indian population had access to the internet, compared to 56.3%, 34.3% and 22.4% for malaysia, china, and thailand respectively. this made them better equipped to fully utilize technological innovations in the insurance sector compared to india. however, with the increasing availability of smartphones, reduced internet tariffs and fast adoption of digital technology, the number of internet users in india stood at 422 million in 2017 according to the telecom regulatory authority of india (trai) annual report, which is roughly 32% of the total population. the telecom ministry expects the number to reach 730 million by 2020.the key here is to be well poised to take full advantage of rapid internet availability to boost further penetration in the indian insurance sector and encourage further innovation and liberalization. a lot of emphasis on insurance technology now is laid on big data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. policybazaar, which began as a website for simply comparing insurance policy prices has now become indias largest online policy marketplace, with a market share of 50% in the online insurance space. with a large repository of data gathered over the years, the yashish dahiya founded the company is able to offer unique products only sold on policybazaar based on customer profiles, such as pay-per-use motor insurance and insurance policies for a term of up to a hundred years. using data analytics, the website can also recommend products and add-ons based on the customers search trends and profile, to ensure a higher chance that the customer will buy the policy. aureus analytics, an analytics firm founded by anurag shah, aims to leverage advanced analytics and machine learning to counter fraud by developing predictive models to assess the probability of a claim being fraudulent. they also use this data to generate customer risk profiles and help speed up the claims settlement. bajaj allianz general insurance has used iot to introduce an insurance cover for school children during their travel in a school bus. the school children are tracked in real-time using gps beacons in their identity cards and are protected against accidents under the insurance cover. a working group set up by the irdai in january 2018 has submitted a report recommending insurance companies to use wearable fitness devices to track a customers health such as blood pressure, heart rate and distance walked and use that data to adequately price premiums for life insurance. these developments indicate a clear shift towards the greater adoption of new technologies in the insurance sector. the huge potential that lies in the relatively untapped indian insurance market has been realized and insurance companies must now work towards this end. the limits of fdi in the insurance sector was raised from 26% to 49% in 2014 and similar to single-brand retail, the government has been mulling increasing the fdi limit to 100%. according to an article by advait rao palepu and subrata panda, who sourced their information from venture intelligence,the total investments in insurance and insurance marketplace companies in india increased from usd 518 million in 2016 to usd 1.49 billion in 2018 led by global investment firms such as softbank, westbridge, kkr, and temasek. armed with foreign funding, technology and copious amounts of data, the insurance sector in india is set to change in unprecedented ways. the spread of online insurance marketplaces will give greater access to information and options for purchasing policies to the rapidly growing base of indian internet users, circumventing the need for brokers and lengthy paperwork, and what was once seen as a daunting process of selecting, paying for and claiming insurance policies will become more streamlined and efficient with the use of machine learning, analytics and automated processes. blackcoffer insights 12 | mansi gupta | vaibhav bajpai | iift kolkata, 2019-21

issues to be resolved before we can commercially use it for transactions. some of the most important drawbacks of
cryptocurrencies like bitcoin right now are as below:scalability:bitcoin can have <7 transactions per second as compared to ~47,000 via payment network giants like visathere is a block limit of 1mb, which amounts to 8gbs per 10 min on a bitcoin block (to match 47,000 transactions per second). this essentially means that home computers cannot process this currently and it has very limited use cases with transactions requiring devices having the high computational powercentralization:high computation power requirement would limit the usage of the network to only those who can afford itthis will eventually lead to fewer validations for the distributed ledger, defeating the whole purpose of using blockchain. (a distributed ledger means that everyone in the network can validate the transaction between two parties)so, it becomes important to have a cheaply available
validation mechanism that can be carried out using a basic broadband connection
in-home/small business computers. if two people have personal transaction
history, its unimportant that it should be posted on the main blockchain every
time a transaction takes place as it could bloat up the blockchain. moreover,
everyday transactions using cryptocurrency is not possible as the cost of
posting a transaction for. lets say buying a coffee, can be more than the
price of coffee itself.introducing the lightning network:lightning network is the latest disruptive technology
being researched currently in fintech to make cryptocurrencies scalable. it
basically adds
an extra layer on top of the main bitcoin blockchain and enables payment
channels between two parties over this layer. micropayments for everyday
transactions can be very easily carried out using this channel. here is how it
works:suppose a buys a coffee
from the nearby coffee shop b daily on her way to work. a and b decide to open
a channel on the blockchain for their everyday transactions. once the channel
(or the lightning network) is open, the two parties can keep a track of their
daily transactions on this ledger. at the end of the month, with the ledger
reflecting balances left with each party, they decide to close the channel.
this final transaction is then recorded on the main bitcoin blockchain. this
reduces the cost of the transaction and enables micropayments for everyday
transactions. micropayment channels can defer updating the main
blockchain with remaining balances at a later date. a large network of
micropayments can be created as a secondary layer on top of the main blockchain
to address the scalability issue and reduce transaction fees. although this solution
is very much in the initial stages, resolving the scalability issue and
reducing transaction fees by taking the transaction out of the main blockchain
will give a big boost to the use of cryptocurrencies.how do payments take place on the lightning network?the two parties exchange a single key for validation
of their spend transactions. they can conduct an unlimited number of transactions
on this channel and finally when one party closes the channel, the balances
will be added to the blockchain.each
user can open a digital wallet to store bitcoins and deposit some coins in it
once the channel is opened (this money is kind of a security deposit on behalf
of both the parties to honor their transaction)once
they need to exchange money after their books are updated, they can sign off
the ledger in the channelfinally,
this will be added to the blockchain once the channel is closedthe network is globally scalable since to reach any
person through connected channels network, you just need to know the path to
connect to that person through leveraging your existing network. once the
network develops in future, the requirement to open a separate channel too
would cease to exist since the algorithm will automatically find the shortest
route to connect to the person whom you want to pay based on the exhaustive
peer to peer network. this would ease inter-country transactions and money can
be sent across internationally within seconds.limitations of the technology since the channel for lightning network is separate and not connected with the main blockchain, it will not be backed by the security of the original blockchain. this can be a major concern for its widespread adoption and the companies should research extensively into this. another challenge is its dependency on the internet. the lightning network is not capable of storing coins digitally in a hardware wallet. this makes it prone to hackers since the wallet will be available online. also, transferring large amounts of money is something that needs further detailed research, since bigger payment might struggle with routing in the network.nevertheless, this technology is really fascinating and has a very broad usage through the implementation of bitcoins and distributed ledger in everyday life. once this is rolled out for customer experience, micropayments will be possible between two parties on blockchain, just as we currently have wallets to transfer money for small purchases. the lightning network has a long way to go and is surely going to become the next big disruption in fintech domain after blockchain.blackcoffer insights 11 | chirag soni - iim bangalore","['disruption', 'fintech', 'lightning', 'networkblockchain', 'distributed', 'ledger', 'technology', 'already', 'around', 'time',

to catch up with the apparent convenience which payments apps seek to provide.
over the years, the size of import and export trade between the u.s. and china
has burgeoned to more than half a trillion dollars.presently payment suppliers have to pre-fund accounts on either facet of dealing in native currencies. this may be costly and result in a poor deal for purchasers. benefitting from favorable exchange rates which come as an added advantage of faster payments is crucial as well.blockchain as a nostrum:blockchain is touted as the solution for global business ills by its ardent supporters. the next big disruptive technology in the payment space blockchain can ease cross-border payments in several ways. the distributed ledger technology (dlt) that underlies cryptocurrencies is currently being deployed by a few providers as the answer. roughly seventy percent of prime international banks are experimenting with it, and recently some big implementations are underwaythe distinctive point of blockchain that reciprocally distrusting parties, geographically agnostic, will reach a sure agreement electronically is a bankers dream. for about the same transaction fee and a more competitive forex rate, api-based blockchain platforms can significantly cut down processing time. this can significantly cut-down costs after nearly a century long-stagnant processing fee of traditional banking. kuangyi wei, head of research and market engagement at management consultancy parker fitzgerald estimates that it can save a third of the current operating costs.blockchain thus offers a cryptographically secure andtrustyplatformwith high transparency. it further enables the bypassing of typical forex rates. small and mid-size firms like that of mr.chandras can thus reap the benefits of the best rates for their business.giants like ibm
are working on designing a universal, cross-country blockchain payments
solution that can herald instantaneously inter-bank transfer. this would
require streamlining multiple steps involving multiple stakeholders transacting
in different currencies.a skeptics
view:distributed ledgers are changeless databases area unit maintained by a network of computers, instead of a centralized authority, and secured by advanced cryptography. these are often described and clunky and difficult to maintain. they require enormous computing power to reconcile everything. the matter is further aggravated by the volume of cross-border payments, banks, and jurisdictions.centralized databases area unit still a lot of
economical than blockchains. over-sold and over-hyped area unit different words
utilized in this context, managing expectations on what blockchain are able to
do are vital.operational resilience has additionally become a significant issue for central banks and regulators. considerations raised regarding dlt embrace privacy, security, measurability, and competitiononly time can tell if blockchain will eventually become the panacea of payments it is heralded to be.blackcoffer insights 11 | shreya doreswamy - indian school of business, hyderabad

a progressively prevalent way is through a developing drift, made a difference by the most recent in-app innovation, called miniaturized scale investing. as the title infers, small scale contributing permits you to contribute cash in little sums, regularly automatically. most smaller-scale contributing happens through mobile-based stages. youll make investmentsyou truly do invest money, and more on that fair aheador check your account on the go along with your cellphone or tablet. the thought is that little speculations made at frequent intervals can include up without much exertion or wallet torment. we are a right here, right presently culture, and in case we are able to arrange a modern combine of shoes whereas strolling down the street.depending on the sort of app you employ, smaller-scale contributing can cruel distinctive things. one way to miniaturized scale contribute is to utilize an app that rounds up the dollar sums on buys you make on a credit or charge card and redirects the additional cash to a speculation account. (there are too miniaturized scale reserve funds apps that occupy additional alter to a reserve funds account. these accounts are for the most part fdic safety net provider and, not at all like venture accounts, are not subject to showcase risk.) using an app on your phone, you enter a few individual data, counting your credit or charge card number or multiple account numbers, since youre frequently able to interface various cards to your account. you must reply a few extra questions planned to decide the sort of investments that fit your venture objectives and work together with your chance resistance. a few small scale contributing apps utilize calculations to make a hazard profile based on your reactions to different questions, at that point make suggestions on how and where you ought to invest your money.
at that point, you ended up as an investor. after you spend $7.50 for a sandwich at lunch, the app rounds up your buy to the closest dollar ($8) and naturally exchanges $0.50 to a venture account. once your round-ups are large enough (say $5), youll be able to utilize that cash to buy stocks or other ventures, or the app might make buys for you naturally based on your venture profile. artificial intelligence-driven investing the chart underneath visualizes how an ai procedure can select stocks based on a better dimensional see of the world. in this case, the target could be a portfolio of developing markets equities that shows cautious, esteem characteristics. the chart maps all recorded values within the rising advertise values (msci em imi) universe. each security is plotted on the surface based on its facilitates to tall dimensional esteem and profit highlights, which are each characterized as a portion of the ai approach. the vertical pivot appears how protective these include combinations have been on normal between 2013 and 2017. the higher the crest, the more cautious in down markets. the more profound the trough, by differentiate, the less cautious. on the proper side of the visualization, a two-dimensional cut appears where well-known developing showcase names portrayed by their esteem and profit characteristics finished this period. this approach characterizes a complex and advancing choice boundary, outlined by the maroon form, inside which stocks are chosen to develop a portfolio. this choice boundary speaks to a steady, defensive/value locale of the outline. it may be a nonlinear locale thats tall dimensional and advances as showcase conditions alter. stocks inside the choice boundary tend to display protective characteristics per se, but the strategy moreover recognizes stocks that tend to have future profit pay development potential as well.

64,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/big-data-analytics-in-healthcare/,Big Data Analytics in Healthcare - Blackcoffer Insights,"quality and affordable healthcare is a vision of all governments across the globe. the high cost of medical service and lack of sufficient infrastructure is detrimental to this vision. in developed countries such as the u.s., reducing healthcare cost is an agenda point of all the politicians. even in india, affordable healthcare will be as important as roti, kapda and makan in the near future. technology can play a big role in reducing healthcare cost and making it more efficient. the vast quantity of data is available with hospitals and insurance providers. big data can play a big role in analyzing this data to produce actionable insight. some of the benefits of using big data are as follows,reduce fraud and waste: fraud has a big
impact on everyone. in fact, the national healthcare anti-fraud association
estimates that fraud costs americans at least $33 billion to $55 billion
annually thats approximately 3-5% of the nations health care spending of
$2.26 trillion. for example: sometimes, providers or hospitals report
procedures or services that were never provided. big data analytics can help an insurance company to discover these frauds. big data can use a huge amount of historical data to identify expected procedure or service for reported illness (identified using diagnosis code). if the expected procedure code doesnt match with a billed procedure code, insurance companies can tag claim as a potential fraud claim. once a claim is tagged as a fraud claim, the manual examiner needs to do additional verification to ensure that the claim is submitted by fraud provider.sometimes, patients fake identity to get the benefit of insurance. using big data, companies can match patients information with services he/she has taken. if services taken by the patient is very different from the past medical history of patients, analytics can tag claim as one of the susceptible fraud claims.storing of data:traditional health care providers find it difficult to store a vast amount of data. more ever, traditional database stores only structured data. big data can solve storage issue by handling huge volume and variety of data. having historical data of the patient can reduce healthcare drastically. improving scheduling of appointments:it is very tough to get a physicians appointment in developed countries. one of my friends, senior director in a multinational bank, got an appointment for hip replacement surgery with a waiting period of six months. he was not able to sit and as a result, he didnt drive or come to the office for six months. the waiting period can be drastically reduced if the hospital is able to forecast the number of patients likely to miss appointments. based on historical data, hospitals can predict the number of no shows and can accordingly schedule appointments so as not to miss any slot because of no shows.reducing overpayment and underpayment made to
hospital:if a health insurance company pays an amount to hospital/provider that is greater than the contracted amount for service, payment is called an overpayment. similarly, if payment made is lesser than the contracted amount for service, payment is called an underpayment. overpayment or underpayment is a big headache for both insurance companies and patients. according to aha data, private insurance companies have consistently overpaid hospitals for inpatient care for more than three decades. these overpayments have varied significantly over the years, but have grown dramatically in the past few years. overpayment or underpayment can happen because of multiple reasons such as system glitch, a coding error. using cognitive analysis, big data can predict the payment amount. if the predicted payment amount is significantly different than the actual payment amount, the system can identify possible overpayments or underpayments. predictive treatment:throughout the world, healthcare is based on diagnosing the presence of disease and subsequently treating the disease if present. early diagnosis of the illness is a major challenge. patients do go for diagnosis only when the symptom is evident. it becomes challenging for the physician to treat illness once illness grows beyond a certain level.predictive or preventive can help to identify if an individual will develop a disease. different forms of health device such as iwatch can capture data and send to the hospital at regular interval of time. using predictive analysis, the hospital can predict if a patient is likely to develop an illness. early diagnosis of illness can help doctors to treat patients effectively and at a lower cost. predictive treatment can reduce the number of days a patient needs to be admitted in the hospital. as inpatient treatment is costlier than outpatient treatment, doctors can discharge patients if he/she thinks that the condition of the patient is not serious. the hospital can monitor the patient remotely using medical sensors and can call the patient to the hospital when it is required. big data plays a big role when a person suffers from multiple illnesses. as per dr. abhishek rai, m.s. ortho of k.e.m. medical college mumbai, it becomes challenging to operate patients when he suffers from multiple illnesses. many a number of times, physicians are not aware of all issues with patients as patients themselves are not aware of all illness. as an example, its tough to operate on a person suffering from diabetes as blood doesnt coat easily for a diabetic person. if a physician doesnt have historical data of a diabetic person, he/she may operate diabetic person wrongly. another example where big data analytics can play a huge role in predicting disease is a genetic disease. if a person has breast cancer, her child is 15-20 percent likely to develop breast cancer. using big data analytics, the system can identify patients likely to suffer from genetic disease and request patients to do timely screening. genetic diseases can be screened in first, second- or third-degree relatives to reduce the morbidity and mortality. timely diagnostic reports:in india, it takes 2-3 days on an average to get an mri scan. delay is not because of lack of medical instruments but because of lack of qualified radiologists. this problem can be mitigated by integrating medical imaging with big data. integration of medical imaging with big data will ensure that radiologists get the report in a short span of time. big data will help not only to reduce the turnaround time required to get reports but also to get better reports. technology can convert image to graphs and charts making it easier for radiologists to read the report. as data works on the principle of abundance instead of scarcity. so, the more data we have, the better the outcomes can be obtained. thus, big data technology is clearly the digital disruptor to revolutionize the healthcare sector by consolidating the data from disparate platforms to build a 360-degree view about the human body and help the healthcare provider to generate solutions to life-threatening problems and improved healthcare opportunities.","['quality', 'affordable', 'healthcare', 'vision', 'government', 'across', 'globe', 'high', 'cost', 'medical', 'service', 'lack', 'sufficient',

in them.analytics is thus becoming very crucial in tracking different types of healthcare trends. advanced analytics touches every aspect ofhealthcare software systemsincluding clinical, operational and financial sectors.the role of analytics in transforming healthcarehealthcare organizations have begun to adopt technologies like pacs imaging systems and emrs or electronic health records that attempts to make sense of the massive data that flows through the system (both structured and unstructured). hence, it is important to know what are the tools that can extract information from the data to generate value and enjoy operational, financial and clinical insights.there are genome analyzers and other analytics tools in the market that help in understanding the facts, and eliminate unwanted/useless details to extract only whats needed. the end result of this is better clinical outcomes for the patient. there are several ways in which healthcare organizations can make use of information collected through various sources.disease surveillance and preventative managementdevelop clinically relevant and more effective diagnostic and therapeutic techniquesdevelopment of a faster, leaner, and more productive r&d pipelineexamples of business intelligence in healthcarethe following examples indicate successful applications,
built on a foundation of advanced analytical capabilities, in the healthcare
industry:unitypoint health in iowa: managed toreduce their risk-adjusted readmission rate by 40%over the course of three years in one of their pilot hospitals by utilizing predictive modeling via business intelligence software.washington state health care authority:reduced unnecessary er visitsby implementing a business intelligence for the healthcare system to electronically integrate and distribute patient data across er departments. hospitals were able to identify patients who visited more frequently than others and share that patients information with other hospitals. this resulted in an overall reduction of frequent er visits by 10%, a decrease in visits by frequent er patients by 10.7%, and scheduled prescription allocation decreased by 24%.predictive analytics is key to enabling hospitals to
properly manage their readmission rates and sidestep costly penalties while
simultaneously addressing important aspects of patient treatment and care.analyticsare changing roles in the healthcare industry. an increasing number of informed patients are taking more responsibility for their own care. likewise, physicians are finding more satisfaction with their positions as positive effects increase. more time spent with individual patients has increased which gives physicians the chance to form a trusted relationship with the patient. physicians want to spend time with their patients to know them, interact with them, and help them. when the time to develop a relationship is diminished, the physician is less satisfied with his or her profession.analytics has
changed the way the healthcare world operates. with the ability to
transform the way medicine has been practiced for years, analytics have
resulted in improved health, reduction in diseases, and more satisfied patients
and physicians.
combine artificial intelligence with data analysisandmachine learning iot, and it is easy to provide proactive care to patients. hence, it would be a good move to invest in analytical solutions that can control and mitigate clinical and financial risks, with new payment bundles and models to go with it. blackcoffer insights 10 | tanmay shrivastava and vishnu bajpai, international management

66,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/challenges-and-opportunities-of-big-data-in-healthcare/,Challenges and Opportunities of Big Data in Healthcare - Blackcoffer Insights,"big datato begin with i shall first like to explain what big data is and why it has become so important in our lives. big data is simply data, but with a huge size. data that is not just voluminous but also growing exponentially with time. such data sets are so large and complex that it is not possible to store or process them using traditional data management tools. so, how huge can this data be? social media sites like facebook generate more than 500 terabytes of new data every day in the form of photos, video uploads, text messages, etc. a singlejet enginecan generatemore than 10 terabytesof data in30 minutesof flight time. with many thousand flights per day, generation of data reaches up to manypetabytes. data contained in these sets are not always structured. it can be semi-structured or even unstructured. when such is the size and dimension of data we can well imagine how complicated it must be to process and analyze it. therefore, modern methods of data analysis are being developed and used to process the information contained in big data sets.opportunities now coming to the opportunities that big data provides, they are not just limited to healthcare. big data analysis is now a disruptive technology which has intervened into numerous fields and proved its worth. healthcare is no exception. big data has the potential to change the entire dynamics of the healthcare industry and improve the quality of life of people. healthcare industry is a very large and complicated system. it involves a lot of risks and always demands better care. however, when a large number of patients seek emergency care the complications as well as the cost rise exponentially. in india, many times, we even lack sufficient infrastructure to support the patients, there is a deficit of beds as well as doctors to provide treatment to the patients. for instance, when epidemics break out and lives are lost at a very alarming rate, we can easily gauge our helplessness. however, the scenario is certainly improving now. with the advent of digitization into the healthcare system, healthcare providers or practitioners are now having access to a huge amount of patient health data. this healthcare big data can be processed and analyzed to identify patient patterns more quickly and effectively. the information obtained can be extremely useful to figure out chronic health issues and provide preventive treatment plans well beforehand so as to curb that disease or disorder from occurring. this method is also known as predictive analysis and it is one of the most crucial benefits of big data in healthcare. this technology can help the healthcare industry in more ways than we can infer. healthcare organizations that have implemented predictive analysis have witnessed a reduction in er visits by providing support and care to patients and decreasing emergency situations.apart from reduced er visits and timely treatment, there are many other benefits of big data and predictive analysis. patients with high-risk life-threatening issues can be provided with more customized treatment facilities. due to lack of data, there exists a lack of proper planning in hospitals. under or over-booking of staff, lack of medical equipment, medicines, and other facilities are a result of inefficient budgeting and ill-management of finances. using predictive analysis these problems can be solved which will lead to reduced costs and efficient management of finances. better staff allocation and admission rate prediction shall facilitate improvement in daily operations of healthcare organizations. by using big data the effect of recency bias could be reduced as well. when we give more importance to recent events and tend to ignore the effect of the older ones, it may lead to incorrect decisions. this is known as recency bias. big data also helps in preventing fraudulent activities which in turn prevents losses of insurance companies. challenges while all of this is changing the healthcare industry for the better, it is not that easy to reap the benefits of big data. there are a whole lot of challenges and vulnerabilities attached to its implementation. one of the biggest challenges is security. healthcare big data contains the personal information and health history of patients. acts of hacking, cyber theft and phishing pose a serious threat to these databases. such data could be stolen and sold for huge sums of money. protection of the patients privacy hence is a serious challenge to big data implementation. also, the data would contain external data apart from medical information. the organization, therefore, has to take care of privacy, legal compliances, and government policies. privacy and security of patients have to be given utmost importance and no breach of any kind can be permitted.the next challenge is data classification and modeling. the size of the data is massive and it is less structured and heterogeneous. classifying such massive data to identify relevant information is a big challenge. modeling of such unstructured data is equally difficult. storage and retrieval is another major challenge. huge cloud servers with sufficient space are required to store such voluminous data. also, the speed should be high so that uploading of data can be done hassle-free. the way storage is a challenge, retrieval also is a matter of concern. integrating the data and getting all relevant systems to link each other is a tough job. the next challenge is a major one in my opinion. finding the right
talent who own the expertise to implement this modern technology is an arduous
task. shortage of required talent is a crisis in the market today. even after
hiring the right talent it is a challenge to retain them. scarce resources like
data scientists are hard to find and even harder to retain. they are easily
poached by competitors. a good and efficient compensation strategy, conducive
work environment, high incentives, opportunities for career growth and development
can be some of the ways of retaining such intellectual talent. in a nutshell, we can conclude that while big data is a disruptive technology which will bring about landmark changes in healthcare dynamics, the challenges and vulnerabilities need to be addressed with the utmost care and sense of responsibility.","['big', 'datato', 'begin', 'shall', 'first', 'like', 'explain', 'big', 'data',

67,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/obstacles-to-data-driven-healthcare/,Obstacles to data-driven Healthcare - Blackcoffer Insights,"sometimes the illness just sits in the body waiting for the right time to bloom!, he remarked. bob was a consultant globe-trotting for 15 days a week and this had finally taken a toll on his health as he sat recuperating in his plush hospital room miles away from his home in new york. gazing out of the window, he suddenly remembered jacob his physician back home calling him up at work a few days ago and warning him to take sufficient rest to control his stress levels as his heartbeat had started showing some irregularities. jacob had been remotely monitoring bobs cardiac information since his cardiac arrest 2 years ago and was able to guide bob with his medication doses and diet based on real-time data. should have realized jacob was not crying wolf when he predicted something might go wrong. bob was in a conference when he felt a shooting pain in his hand and he knew he was having another cardiac arrest but before he could alert anybody his vision blurred and he fell to the ground. ray who was at the conference rushed to bob and reached for his wallet to find his health information card that carried his unique patient identity (upi) details. every second counted as bobs breathing slowed and as the sirens blared into his ears ray could see the paramedics jump out of the ambulance with complete charts of bobs previous medical records that were available against the upi ray had provided. as ray climbed into the ambulance, he saw that the paramedics had started the preliminary round of treatment based on the real-time vital stats, past medical history, and inputs from a cardiologist who was remotely monitoring the situation from the hospital. bob was safe.this is what technology can achieve, empowering every healthcare provider to make the best efforts to save lives backed by powerful insights from data. this story could have been a tale in the present but it is not. so, with such huge volumes of data being generated at every step in the healthcare value chain and enough advances in technology to explore varied data, what is stopping us from using technology and being data-driven in healthcare today?for any industry to be data-driven the main element of decision-making is you guessed it right data and this is exactly where the problem lies. for a data-driven approach to making complex decisions, it is imperative to collect relevant, high quality, consistent and reliable data that can be utilized to derive useful insights and predict future outcomes with high accuracy. thus if healthcare needs to fully exploit data and analytics it needs to develop three strong capabilities integration of data from multiple sources, capability to build and develop advanced analytical models with lower error margins and the ability to transform the organization into a breeding ground for deep insights and predictive prognosis with the right mindset inclined to adopting transformation so that the analytical models drive results.data collection and integration: finding the right data is the major challenge in any analytics project and more so in healthcare, the major reason being low adoption rates of digital data capturing methods and high data fragmentation.(a) low adoption of digital practices means that healthcare providers still rely on manual modes of data entry like notes or oral recommendations to convey a patients medical information. despite being one of the most technologically advanced countries the electronic health records (ehr) adoption rate is only 67% as of the end of may 2017. this is dismal state and analytics based on such limited information is not a good representation of the actual population. in developing countries, the percentages are more disappointing with low digitized data available and lesser interoperability. electronic medical records (emr) is more prevalent than ehr which means if bob visited any health provider apart from jacob there are high chances his medical records are not available.bob wears a fitbit that tracks his activity levels and sleep pattern details.he also uses the myfitnesspal app on his mobile to keep a check on his calorie intake.he is a regular social media user and often posts about his day on the platforms.(b) with the growth in technologies like remote monitoring, wearables, social media analytics, etc. bob as a patient is generating a lot of real-time data from his wearable devices and apps. his social media interactions can be analyzed using text analytics to explore and predict any mental health issues. these can be considered as one major source of data for analytics. clinical data like ehr and emr, monthly/ yearly credit card transactions used to make medical payments, medical claim settlements, genetic databases, public records, are major sources of data for analytics.this makes the data sources too fragmented and difficult to work on due to dissimilar syntaxes. fragmented database seldom leads to standardized good quality data. also, every organization has a different goal to achieve with the data it collects and hence the nature of data captured by each is different.(c) bob had a upi that made it easy for the paramedics to serve him to the best of his interest and do all this in the least turnaround time. no upi or any unique identifier for the patient makes it difficult to integrate patient data from different sources. countries like australia, canada, france, new zealand, norway, sweden and the u.k which have advanced on their ehr capabilities to achieve almost a 100% adoption rate with high interoperability have done so by employing upis.organization mindset:jacob faced a lot of resistance from the nurses in his clinic when he announced the introduction of cpoe and ehr machines for entry of data. the nurses earlier used to manually write patient information and now felt threatened as the machines had taken over the jobs. resistance to the adoption of technology due to job reduction impacts skill gap to adopt to technology leading to higher costs on training.with huge volumes of data being generated the threat from security, standpoint needs to be addressed. since healthcare entails a lot of sensitive information about the patient there is a heightened risk of thefts that can paramount to identity theft. from 2014 to 2015, the number of individuals affected by protected health information breaches increased from approximately1.8 million to approximately 110 million in the us alone. without a data governance structure in place, patients would fear and shun providers implementing e-entry of data. healthcare providers can be reluctant to set up standard data that promote data interoperability as standardization of emr data might make it easier for patients to switch health providers. thus, imposing such barriers to exit is a convenient way to retain patient base which in turn restricts the possibilities for analytics as a wide-scale implementation. advanced analytics: the ibm watson ai debacle with inaccurate cancer predictions has raised a very important question on whether machines can be trusted with complex decisions? in a business where the cost of failure is a life the value of which cannot be monetized a lot is at stake. analytical models need to be trained to be able to make predictions with higher recall and this is possible only when the training data is quality data that accurately defined the past and as-is situationdata is ever-changing and variables like regulatory changes, environmental factors, etc. can change the analytical model in many ways and hence keeping up with such data is a big challenge.deep learning models for prediction act as a black box with no clear understanding of how the predicted outcome is impacted by the input features. the program, named deep patient, was trained using a large training dataset of over 700,000 individuals. without any expert intervention, it discovered patterns in the data that predicted when people were on the way to a wide range of ailments, especially mental illnesses and cancer which was a breakthrough. however, the only problem is that researchers are not yet sure how it was able to arrive at the results as the complete model is a blackbox. this might increase the risk of the wrong diagnosis as there is no certainty of under which scenario the model might fail.the only way to overcome these challenges is to layout stronger data governance laws, ensure government regulations that do not allow providers to create barriers to exit for the patients and incentivize healthcare providers to adopt digital transformation strategies. the health insurance portability and accountability act (hipaa) is a step in the right direction to protect patient health information (phi) and mandates providers to set up a compliant infrastructure for threats against security. however, we still have a long way to go before the fears of both the health care providers and patients with electronic modes of capturing data are assuaged and we have better capabilities for capturing relevant data giving the much-needed impetus to analytics in healthcare.

differentiators of the most innovative companies. service design is the best
approach to innovate and create new data monetization applications.a framework for data monetizationtoday, mega-companies such as facebook and google
derive a large portion of their revenue from the effective utilization of data.
they have mastered the art of data monetization turning data assets into
cold, hard cash. these companies offer a free, public service that allows them
to harvest massive amounts of data about their users. they then provide this
data for a fee to advertisers that want to create a personalized
marketing experience.here are several potential opportunities for data
monetization:identifying new revenue opportunities (products, markets, or customer segments)improving marketing impact through personalizationidentifying and proactively responding to customer satisfaction levelsminimizing customer churn and extending customer retentionoptimizing the supply chain through data sharing with partnersdiagnosing revenue leaks and instituting corrective measuresdetecting and preventing fraud and piracystart
to monetize your data todaybut to really know if youre ready to
monetize, you need to access what you have before you attempt to earn revenue
from your information, make sure that it is:dependablerelevantsegmentsecure and anonymizeddeveloping capability for data monetizationbusiness models are already changing through the
exploitation of information. to be successful in this age of data monetization,
you must think creatively about how you hire talent and develop leaders.the c-suite executives who will help your business
succeed today, and certainly tomorrow, will be different from the people who
led blue-chip firms 30, 20 or even 10 years ago. the route you take to data
monetization will have an impact on the resources and capabilities your
organization needs to steal a march on its rivals.you and your people must adapt to this second wave of big data exploitation, where insight shapes the new product and service development. if the way to make dollars is through data, then your organization and its people must make that shift. get your capability ready now.business

impact to customers, analytics sophistication, and revenue potential.data as a service.also known as data
syndication, this is the simplest of the three business models. anonymized and
aggregated data are sold either to intermediate companies or end customers who
mine the data for insights. insight as a service.companies also
can combine internal and external data sources, applying advanced analytics to
provide actionable insights. akzonobel has created a decision-support model for
ship operators to enable fuel and co2savings. they make
available to ship operators and owners an advanced analytics-enabled mobile ios
app that provides continuous performance prediction of coating technologies.
this approach empowers vessel operators by allowing financial and performance
benefit analysis of coating choices, thus optimizing important investment
decisions.analytics-enabled platform as a service.this is the most
complex of the three business models, and it offers the greatest value to
customers. companies use sophisticated and proprietary algorithms to generate
enriched, highly transformed, customized real-time data delivered to customers
via cloud-based, self-service platforms. setting up a
data factoryto maximize the potential for internal and external monetization,
companies should set up a data factory that automates the process of
collecting, enriching, transforming, and deriving insights from data. its a
complex undertaking requiring a set of design principles that touch on design
thinking, lean start-up, and agile methodologies for success.create a data platform.the architecture and technology stack that supports a data monetization business model typically involves a robust enterprise data strategy, and a data platform with an intuitive interface to allow analysis, synthesis, modeling, and interaction with the data at a higher, more visual level.turning data
into a strategic assetall companies are data companies, and most have a substantial amount of
untapped, underutilized data, which could unlock tremendous financial value.there are three key components to complementing and even transforming a
business model with a data factory:identify potential internal and external
monetization opportunities.appraise your data, identify any hidden
opportunities to enrich it, and increase insight value.develop a strong monetization strategy and
assess business opportunities, dependencies, and capability gaps.key areas
where data monetization can impact your business.managed services provision: data gives some firms an opportunity to pivot. take telecom businesses, which have traditionally focused on network provision. the capital expenditure associated with these core activities is high and will only increase with the launch of 5g. smart operators are looking at their huge data assets and creating new routes to market.mobility: companies that have hooked into the connected automobile ecosystem are already creating valuable products and services. insurance firms, for example, areusing telematics to monitor driver performanceand charge premiums based on behavior.payments: payments data comes in multiple forms. enterprise-level information includes customer preferences, line-of-business data, and needs assessment. supplemental data includes raw data from external sources such as social media and weather channels. the merchant ecosystem, meanwhile, provides another conduit of information.logistics: logistics is the worlds biggest integrated system. every movement requires a huge amount of information about flow, and smart businesses are tapping into this insight to see when the cost of movement is likely to be lowest. ups, for example, isusing telematics and advanced algorithms to create optimal routes for delivery drivers.health care: new entrants recognize the potential financial gains from data monetization in health care. experts suggest thatalphabet has at least nine life and science companies, while amazon is looking at opportunities to use big data to transform health care.conclusionvery few organizations
have established methods for data asset management. it is not easy to implement
if the business is not built on data from the beginning. but it is not enough
for data to be used only for the purposes of monitoring and maintaining
physical assets. that data needs to be monetized. this, in part, is a process
of generating new revenues from data that currently serves another purpose.","['data', 'held', 'company', 'real', 'treasure', 'reveals', 'value', 'creating', 'new', 'service', 'monetization', 'data',

69,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/traceability-of-information-master-your-data-capital/,Traceability of information - Master your data capital - Blackcoffer Insights,"thedemocratizationof data access and usage in the enterprise is underway. establishing data governance and organization-wide information management becomes a must.metadata management allows theend-to-end traceability, from data sourcing to data consumption. this traceability is required for personal data by regulations such asgdpr.traceabilitytraceability means transparency of flows of goods and data a basic requirement for a modern supply chain.consumers, authorities and various quality assurance and product standards demand transparent information on raw materials and primary packaging. brand owners need to be able to fully answer questions quickly, at the batch level, on the source of raw materials, production methods, and staging points. with a good traceability information system, a brand owner can guarantee protection for consumers and itself. it can quickly contain any problems and provide adequate information, which builds confidence among consumers and the authorities.solutionwe choose muml as the underlying software design method due to its existing support for real-time, and due to our preliminary work on the approach (cf. sect. 4). furthermore, we rely on consensusfor the specification of requirements due to its tight integration with muml. more precisely, we provide the following partial solutions to the traceability problem for information flow requirements:specification of illegitimate information flow at the level of consensussystem models. to address challenge c1, we provide systems engineers with a specification technique for information flow requirements, allowing them to mark a flow between elements of a system, or its environment, as illegitimate. the specification needs to take place in a form that enables a later comparison against the actual information flow detected through verification. thus, by distinguishing illegitimate from legitimate flow, it is possible to judge whether the information flow requirements are violated.deriving verifiable information flow properties from the specified requirements in an automatic fashion. as a contribution to challenge c3, the derived properties relate the initial requirements to a muml software design model and allow to verify the models compliance. in order to produce meaningful verification results, the derived properties need to preserve the semantics of the initial requirements and, therefore, the derivation needs to interrelate the consensussystem model and the muml software design model. it is beneficial to infer the relation between these models automatically from the traces of a model transformation.real-time verification of non-interference properties on the basis of software design models. in order to overcome challenge i.e., to decide whether a given muml model fulfills the derived information flow properties, rigorous verification of the non-interference needs to be carried out. to this end, we enrich the theoretical basis of real-time non-interference by a ready-to-use verification technique. to cope with the infinite, real-valued state space, we explicitly consider the applicability of existing verification techniques from the area of real-time model checking.reinterpretation of the verification results to trace them back to the initial requirements as a further contribution to challenge c3. depending on the complexity of the interrelations between muml software design and conses system model, the verification results obtained so far are of little significance, as they do not allow the engineers to draw immediate conclusions about the initial information flow requirements. therefore, in order to give significance to the results, we automatically relate them back to the requirements specified initially. every specified requirement needs to be marked as met (if the non-occurrence of information flow has been proved by the verification), or as a violation (if the verification detected the occurrence of an illegitimate flow).previous studies have shown that software traceability, the ability to link together related artifacts from different sources within a project (e.g., source code, use cases, documentation, etc.), improves project outcomes by assisting developers and other stakeholders with common tasks such as impact analysis, concept location, etc. establishing traceability links in a software system is an important and costly task, but only half the struggle. as the project undergoes maintenance and evolution, new artifacts are added and existing ones are changed, resulting in outdated traceability information. therefore, specific steps need to be taken to make sure that traceability links are maintained in tandem with the rest of the project. in this article, we address this problem and propose a novel approach called trail for maintaining traceability information in a system.advantages and benefits of full traceabilitytraceability in an open supply chain which help company in achieving:increase customer satisfaction and safetyin the event a recall does take place, manufacturers are able to minimize the impact by only recalling those items with the specific serial numbers that were built with the faulty component, material or process thus significantly reducing expenses and customer impact.meet government and compliance mandatesease the burden and lessen the chances for fines and penalties associated with noncompliance.improve data accuracyreduce human error.save millions in lost revenue, recall costs, damage control campaigns, litigation, and fines.mobile track-and-trace solutions can prevent quality issues before they occur or, in the event of a product recall, allow manufacturers to act swiftly as well as narrow the scope of the recall to reduce exposure to negative brand impressions and damage to revenues.reduce warranty claim coststraceability enables manufacturers to accurately analyze the root cause of a product or part failure to recover warranty costs from liable suppliers.with automation and traceability solutions for discrete manufacturers, you can track warranty and part information to up-sell and cross-sell complementary products and services.in addition, labor hours can be reallocated to focus on revenue-generating activities versus the double reporting that occurs when data is collected manually and then later transferred into a computer system. for that purpose, a traceability system identifies objects by usinga representation format such as serial numbers or lot numbers, as well asthe transfer mediumsuch as labels and rf tags.when all people related to the supply chain, including consumers, can recognize the status of the product and objects and information has been linked, tracing forward/back can be done easily. this ensures the quality and safety of the product.
we currently work towards reducing the verification problem to a refinement check for real-time systems. after preparing the verification backend, we plan to address the requirements specification at the level of model-based systems engineering, and the derivation of verifiable properties within the next year. finally, we intend to carry out the final integration of systems engineering and software design in order to establish the desired traceability solution. our evaluation strategy enables us to carry out a stepwise, incremental validation of our contributions.","['thedemocratizationof', 'data', 'access', 'usage', 'enterprise', 'underway', 'establishing', 'data', 'governance', 'organization', 'wide', 'information', 'management', 'becomes',

70,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/bank-risk-management-india/,Bank Risk Management in India - Blackcoffer Insights,"current scenario:in the past 2 years, indian banks have seen rapid growth in stressed assets with npas climbing from 3% to 13% of the total assets. in 2017-18 the gnpa ratio rose to 23.1 % from 18.1% last year. the primary culprits of this have been public sector banks who have given and renewed loans to unworthy corporates like nirav modi, kingfisher airlines. another big blow to the banking sector came in september 2018 in the form of il & fs crisis. infrastructure leasing and financial services, a publicly owned nbfc defaulted on loans worth rs. 91000 crore which led to a liquidity crisis across indian nbfcs which had an impact on indian banks as well. due to these developments, the trust on indian financial sector seems to be lost and the rbi is taking a set of measures to revive the financial sector.strategies to control npaspreventive management: preventive management is to save the asset from becoming npa. this involves maintaining due diligence and doing proper credit assessment before granting loans.curative management: the curative measures are designed to speed up recoveries so that money which is locked up in npas is released quickly.curative strategy:to control the situation, india had to definitely go for the curative strategy first. insolvency and bankruptcy code (ibc) was passed in 2016. it has proved to be a major shot in the arm for the banks to fight npas. since then it also has been amended several times to give it more strength. the rbi also dissolved the existing corporate debt restructuring (cdr) for more comprehensive frameworks like sdr (strategic debt restructuring), s4a and 5/25. the new measures facilitate the conversion of outstanding loans into a majority shareholding in the company. also, they allow that for even a single day of default, the bank can send the case to ibc (adhikari, 2018). in march 2018, rbi implemented the ban on lenders on issuing locs and lous for issuing overseas loans.challenges to banking reforms:though such due diligence is good in preventing the npas, they have had limited effect only. transition to sdr though a good move has not seen much success and in only one case it has shown some results, the case of gammon india. ibc has met some success but there are many challenges like lack of infrastructure. so far only 11 nclt benches have been set up across india. (upadhyay, 2019) .the move to ban buyers credit has had an impact on trade financing in india. importers used this instrument to avail of cheaper credit to pay suppliers. post this ban, they will have to rely upon bank guarantees which comes with its own limits. also, the ban on lcs will mean that corporates who have taken lcs will have to pay back as there will be no rollover. (archana & gopakumar, 2018). preventive strategy: after addressing these challenges to curative strategy, it is important to implement a preventive strategy so that banks can prevent loan write-offs in the future. an important aspect related to this is the basel norms. basel is a city in switzerland and it is the location of the headquarters of the bank of international settlements (bis) which is the international body that sets rules for banking. currently, the indian banks are transitioning to basel-iii norms. basel-iii norms have been implemented on april 1, 2013, and will be fully implemented as on march 31, 2020. one of the key shortcomings of the earlier basel accords was that it approached solvency of each institution independently.basel-iii has set its objectives to improve the shock absorbing capacity of each and every individual bank as the first priority and in the worst case, if one or banks fail, it ensures that banking system as a whole does not crumble as a spill-over effect. key aspects of basel-iii normsbasel-iii norms identified sifis (systematic important financial institutions) and set a higher requirement for absorbency ratio than other banks because of their greater risk to the financial system. a tier-i extra capital ranging from 1-2.5% for these banks. (shakdwipee & mehta, 2017)the basel iii capital regulations continue to be based on three mutually reinforcing pillars, viz. minimum capital requirements, supervisory review of capital adequacy, and market discipline of the basel ii capital adequacy framework. the overall capital adequacy ratio proposed by rbi is at 11.50 % as against 9.00% at present. moreover, the additional leverage ratio has been introduced at 4.50 %. (rbi, 2015)two minimum standards viz. liquidity coverage ratio (lcr) and net stable funding ratio (nsfr) for funding liquidity were prescribed by the basel committee (rbi, 2012).these aspects are illustrated in the figure given below: source: (shakdwipee & mehta, 2017) macroeconomic effect of basel-iii normsthe increase in capital requirements will increase the weighted cost of capital for banks which will increase the lending rates.bringing the common equity capital ratio to a level that would meet the agreed common capital requirement and capital conservation buffer would bring down the gdp.result of basel-iii normsclearly, the immediate effect has to be negative and it was visible in the year 2016 when psbs posted significant losses. fitch ratings stated that the progressive increase in minimum capital requirements under basel iii is likely to put nearly half of indian banks in danger of breaching capital triggers.fitch estimates that indian banks will require around usd90bn in new capital by fye19 to meet basel iii standards, with the state banks accounting for about 80% of the total. (hindu business line, 2018).due to this, the government has to extend the deadline to implement basel-iii norms for indian banks by a year. (hindu business line, 2018).after studying all this, one thing is clear that implementing basel-iii norms even in next year wont be a cakewalk. the banks need to overhaul their risk management practices in order to bring this regulatory change.the expanding role of risk management: basel-iiiwhile on one hand, basel-iii increases cost in the form of technological investment it also presents an opportunity it presents an opportunity for banks to assess their operations and look for opportunities to create efficiency. in the long run, it will influence banks to move to a culture of risk and evidence-based decision making. (cognizant, 2013).technology has to take a central role in risk management to bring operational efficiency. the organization needs to break silos and work as a single unit to discover insights where it needs to improve. some examples can be:considering liquidity management as a key aspect in processes such as deciding the product portfolio will help banks enhance their offerings.merging similar type risk management systems, for example, consolidating anti-fraud and anti-money laundering system, banks will be able to apply advanced analytics which will help them increase operational efficiency.integrating products data such as credit card and deposits, banks can find new ways to market their products and new target customers.the road ahead: insightsimplementing basel-iii is no cakewalk and each bank needs to take a deep analysis of its processes. they should invest in prudent technological investments and bring operational efficiency in their processes. use of fintech can be one option.other than that, bigger industry players can find ways to collaborate with third-party experts, like cloud service providers and provide small and emergent players consultancy on risk management.banks may try to divest capital intensive businesses or try to merge them with synergistic businesses such as merger of indiabulls housing finance and laxmi vilas bank shows.","['current',

71,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/advance-analytics-for-refocusing-profits/,Advance Analytics for Refocusing Profits - Blackcoffer Insights,"recent years have seen significant growth in personal financial wealth. in 2017 alone, there was more than 12 percent growth in personal financial wealth. opportunities posed by this growth are tremendous, but the wealth managers are struggling to manage their profit margins or increase their profit margins. this is due to a plethora of causes like stricter regulation by the institution, increase in demanding customer and digital disruption. still, the top performers in the segment are enjoying more margin than others and this difference is continuously increasing.revenue is more important than the cost reduction in driving profits. top performers those with higher pre-tax profit margins achieved a significant advantage over average performer by focusing on revenue growth and return on assets in past years, along with significantly better price realization in every client segment as cited by a researcher from bcg. the top performer also enjoys a cost advantage, but that is less pronounced than roa. this suggested that the revenue is the main driver for profit margin.the manager can achieve higher revenue by adjusting price levels, removing unnecessary discounts and simplifying overall pricing structure. pricing information is easily available, combining with analytics and data tools, they become truly powerful. the manager should understand the present abnormalities and inconsistent for optimizing the pricing opportunities and driving the margins. they can focus on two major areas.firstly, the realization of pricing offered to the client. managers often give discounts to book business at the expense of revenue margin. companys weak guidance for discounting the customer and infrequent review of the existing discounts exemplifies the issue. furthermore, often the manager fails to apply fees increase to the existing clients. using the value-based pricing offering discounts based on requirement and timely removal of the discount the system will help in capitalizing this revenue gap.secondly, designing the pricing system for the organization. pricing should be based on the value generated and perceived by the customer. most of the existing pricing is complex and opaque, which makes it difficult for the customer (even the manager) to understand. this creates an improper product bundle and misprices offering to the customer. organization loosely defines the client segment, which extends the pricing benefit beyond the intended client segment.implementing smart pricing system can significantly drive the revenue. a successful pricing transformation should consider various factors like adjustment to deal with pricing outliers, stringent policies for tracking and reporting the realization of the price at client and manager level, managers training and coaching, and incentives to the manager for implementing the smart pricing system.some managers may have misperceived risk of client attrition. in recent research, it has been found that clients are not specially priced sensitive. most of the clients have very low awareness about the fees that managers charges. though they appreciate discount they are not aware of what exactly has been offered to them. importantly, most clients focus far more on the overall experience they receive. by increasing the overall client experience and satisfaction, the organization can reap remarkable benefits. a content customer shows certain kinds of behavior hard to quantify leads to increased and stable revenue. they tend to use more of institutional services and refers to their friends and relatives. according to recent research, the building block of selection and retention of content clients are trust, reassurance, personalized experience, convenience and investment performance on par with other service providers. moreover, clients expectation and needs change with time, the service provider must change to cater to those needs.a service provider must be able to provide a personalized experience and meet the changing needs of the client. personalize experience can be created by leveraging the full spectrum of existing data and using advanced analytics to make a personalized profile based on customer needs, preferences, context, and experience. sharp execution of customized experience from delivering the standard experience is challenging. for accomplishing this enormous task, firms need to develop a new cutting-edge technology based advance analytics capacities using a new technology platform, next-generation technology, and data architecture, and improved access to the internal and external data. some players are taking actions in smaller steps by developing a small and new analytics team, and investing in a new platform.customer experience can be further enhanced by generating curated communication and finding the optimal frequency and medium for communication using analytics. such analytics can also flag ways to reduce unwanted communication and an ideal time for initiating cross-selling and drive a customer toward research and investment ideas in specific sectors. moreover, it will also maximize the relationship manager(rm) efficiency by defining the adequate frequency of client communication (especially for low-frequency communication client). rm could divide his crucial time propositional to the real value of the client to the firm. refined procedure or sequence can be established for client communication in case of market abnormally for reassurance and retention. this optimization will help rm to increase the portion of time toward client acquisition, which will directly impact business expansion.
advanced analytics can also increase the top line growth in addition to the above-mentioned points. analytics can identify the early signs of potential client attrition by observing the trading pattern. in a few recent cases, the firm was able to identify the possible client attrition by observing the trading pattern and able to mitigate by successful communication. in these cases earlier the identification easier for firms to retain clients. few recent research has shown that the firm can decrease the client attrition by 10 to 20% using specific analytics technique. furthermore, sharpen the target price based on client-specific price sensitivity, individual scenario, and long term perspective. the dynamic pricing model can also be created.the success of the advanced analytics will depend on having or developing a foundation of the key capabilities. combining them effectively and managing the complexity will need tenacious leadership. few of the key capabilities that the firm should look for are cutting edge technology architecture, sharp data capture and governance, innovative analytics capabilities, and change management. with cutting edge technology there is no single solution for all players. it varies from players and market, and the firm must be ready to iterate for the ideal technology. but the technology should provide a single outcome to the result and able to find relevant data from the large pool of structured and unstructured data.major challenges lie in capturing and structuring already existing data. the specific history of the client, or winning strategy for specific clients. the firm can develop a model to capitalize and analyze the technique used by experience rm toward acquisition, retaining and deriving customer satisfaction for specific clients. this model will be difficult to build because most of the data variable will be difficult to quantify. a firm must develop their innovative analytics capabilities, for creating difficult models and improving the analysis of currently available data. knowing how to apply the right analytics method to a business problem requires a different type of investment other than system and data.taking the first step is the most difficult point for the firm. the firm can take one of the two most common practice approaches. firstly, firms can create a detailed road map. then invest in the required capabilities and makes necessary organizational changes accordingly. secondly, learning by doing, rapidly creating and prioritizing a long list of use cases specific to the firm. the second case has a higher chance of success for the firm.","['recent', 'year', 'seen', 'significant', 'growth', 'personal', 'financial', 'wealth', 'alone', 'percent', 'growth', 'personal', 'financial',

prominent reason why big data started gaining popularity. banking, being the backbone of every country, plays a vital role in the development of the financial system of an economy. banking helps to boost the financial system of an economy. since the last two decades, the size of data has grown by a huge amount and value. storage of information in digital form has already taken place in india. due to digitalization, a large amount of data has become feasible to utilize. investments in big data analytics in the banking sector was around $20 billion in 2016, as per the idc semi-annual big data and analytics spending guide of 2016. the four vs of big data (velocity, volume, variety, and veracity) have impacted the banking sector at various points in time.data volume: the size of available data has been growing at an increasing rate. this applies to companies and to individuals.data velocity: velocity is the measure of how fast the data is coming in.data variety: it stands for the plenitude of data types processed, and the banks do have to deal with huge numbers of various types of data.data veracity: uncertainty due to data inconsistency and incompleteness.big data has applications in various branches in the banking and finance sectors such as marketing, risk management, operations, etc.risk managementsince it gives an advantage over competitors, it is a source of profit for financial institutions. big data analytics companies evaluate the risk of various customers of banks and financial institutions. data analytics helps to remove the biases taken in management decisions. risk analytics plays an important role in fraud analytics, credit policy, and modelling.the spending patterns and previous credit history of a customer can help rapidly assess the risks of issuing a loan.in march 2014, there were only 5,090 wilful defaulters who defaulted on rs 39,504 crore. this grew steadily over the years to number 11,046 wilful defaulters and rs 161,213 crore by december 2018, as per the cibil list.financial institutions have a sufficient amount of data in order to realize and mitigate the future risk posing from their customers. there are data science startups tied up with different financial institutions to asses the risk of their customers. currently, there are approximately 60,000 data science and financial analytics professionals in india, working in the finance sector.rubix data sciences pvt ltd company is a startup which asses the credit risk of their clients. these companies have expertise in managing and monitoring the customers of their clients on a real time basis through data analytics.customer segmentation and profilingin one of the first studies, mckinsey global institute (mgi) pointed out in its 2014 report on global flows in a digital age, how apart from goods and services, digital flows across countries do contribute to economic development. one of the biggest factors is social media, which has opened new avenues and opportunities for organizations to connect with their customers. however, the huge volume of brands, products, and services, discussed, shared, criticized or liked on different social platforms can be overwhelming. sentiment analytics helps to rapidly read all this data and provide a summary of what people like and do not like about a company or its products. it helps the company make better decisions on their products.through analytics the customer segmentation and profiling on the basis of customer spending patterns, for instance, a person who is a heavy loan payer may exhaust all his income at once, can help the banks or financial institutions to plan the bottom line and maximize their income. with the help of big data analytics, banks can analyze the market trends and decide on lowering or increasing interest rates for different individuals across various regions.policy formation and regulatory normsdata analytics tools are used by the rbi to monitor inflation on a real-time basis. the financial system is now completely computerized, as large volumes of data are generated on a daily basis. a dynamic database of bank lending activity could help a regulator spot outlier activity that may lead to trouble later. this assumes that data across the banking sector is aggregated. trends in retail lending can also be spotted by plugging into the databases of consumer credit rating agencies. big data analytics can help to analyze the ongoing activity in the financial system and mitigate the upcoming risk.in spite of tightening regulations, there are financial frauds in companies. as mentioned previously the list of defaulters in the last five years has increased drastically. tracking the spending patterns of an individual can help to develop stringent regulations for high spending individuals and vice-versa.","['great', 'recession', 'prominent', 'reason', 'big', 'data', 'started', 'gaining', 'popularity', 'banking', 'backbone', 'every',

73,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/mitigating-bank-risk-management/,Mitigating Bank risk management - Blackcoffer Insights,"while buying shares or playing a betting game, we all might have used or heard the word.risk!!! now, what does the word risk mean its a fear of losing something of value, many times in monetary terms. the same saying goes for any financial institution. bank operates in a dynamic business environment and faces multiple risks. with risk, comes the concept of risk management. risk management refers to the identification and assessment of potential risk and the development and execution of plans to deal with such risks. in the banking industry, risk managementfocuseson managing the banks exposure to losses or risk and to protect the value of its assets, revenue, operations, business, andreputation.to understand the future of bank risk management,
let us quickly go through the major banking risk one by one liquidity risk risk when banks are not able to meet its short term financial obligations and day to day operational expense, leading to cash-crunch. credit risk risk of default of debt payment by the borrower attributes to credit risk. one can relate the credit risk with the 2007-08 financial crises were credit fell and the borrower was unable to pay their debts, which then turned into liquidity crises for the banks. strategic risk risk arising from the banks long term strategy. the bank needs to be agile to the needs of changing the business environment, or else it can lose market share.compliance risk risk arising from failure to comply with enforced laws and regulations. reserve bank of india fine on 19 banks including icici for failing to comply with its guidelines on the use of global payment network swift is a good example of compliance risk.cyber security risk phishing, malware, crypto-jacking, denial of service attack could affect the integrity and confidentiality of information.reputational risk risk of loss of confidence of public like punjab national bank, the second largest public sector bank in india, was defrauded for more than ~$1.8 billion by the largest diamond and jewelry businesses in the country, making it the largest fraud to be detected.operation risk faulty internal process, systems, and human errors lead to operational risk.now how the
future of the bank risk management will look like process automation in the coming decade, most of the routine operational business process in risk dealing with customers will be automated. ai, algorithms, machine learning will lead to increase in productivity and will help banks to reduce operational cost and chances of human error, thereby managing operational risk, compliance risk, and credit rate.some banks had already started investing in process automation. bny mellons, an american banking company, efforts to transition staff members to robotics and automation have resulted in huge sustained cost savings and increased productivity. as a result, there was better accuracy and faster processing, reducing transaction time and eliminating manual steps. thus, resources redeployment created greater value for its clients.robust data infrastructure there will be a need for reliable data pool at the back end and flexible infrastructure at the front end. this will make the customer more engaged with the bank through real-time data processing (like loan approval.) there will be huge investments in it infrastructure, data centers, and software. a robust data infrastructure will be key to banking operation efficiency and risk minimization in the future.td bank, a us national bank, has embarked on an effort to transform traditional banking data infrastructure into a more modern system built on a new application framework and apis.collaborations to meet the competition, many banks might collaborate with peer banks or fintech startups to retain and gain a customer base and to manage third-party risk.fintech startups are the new buzz of the market, which provides highly competitive and seamless zero documentation services to customers, focusing on niche areas of the supply chain origination, sales, and distribution. bank can collaborate with these fin-tech companies or peer banks in effectively managing third-party risk.banks like citizens bank, ally bank have joined together as investors and members in ky3p a company dedicated to working with the financial industry to standardize best practices for managing third-party risk and optimizing the processes by which financial institutions assess and monitor inherent risk in engaging suppliers and entering into third-party relationships.analytics and machine learning it is a tool which will be widely used by the financial institutions especially where data needs to be interpreted and acted upon. it will help banks to manage risk-appetite, by providing meaningful data patterns and trends, which will form the base for decision making-like improvement in the identification of risky customers (considering default risk). from top to bottom, machine learning will be integrated into the process and will become an integral part of the overall process.paypal is one of the best examples the company, which supports 7.8 billion payment transactions annually in more than 200 countries around the world, is deploying technology thereby enabling the usage of data-driven intelligence across the entire value chain.manpower talent pool in the coming future, there will be a shift of resources allocation from processes to data analytics. at present, almost 50% of staff is handling operational process which will be bought down to 15-20% and analytics will employ 40% of manpower (which is 15% at present) bank will hire a lot of different talent pool who understand application of data analytics and statistics in decision making. banks will partner with top universities and institutes (featuring training in data analytics) as a part of risk management. apart from hiring, retaining talent and continuous knowledge upgrade will also become a focus area for banks.system audits since many operations will be automated, system audits will play a very crucial role to ensure reliability and efficiency of data systems. system audit will play a crucial role in identifying loopholes in the systems and thus, bringing out areas of the potential risk so that timely corrective action plans can be put in place to mitigate risk. auditing in the future will focus on creating risk-based audit plans and testing the frameworks, rather than just controls. cyber security mobile and internet penetration has rocketed the use of internet banking. increasing the risk of leakage of confidential information can put operations of the bank to halt. the average cost of cybercrime for financial services has increased from $12.97 million usd per firm in 2014 to $18.28 million usd in 2017, which is almost 40 percent over the past three years. to minimize cyber risk, the bank will make major investments in cybersecurity. minimize cybersecurity threat in the future will be one of the most challenging tasks in the future, considering its nature and huge risk potential attached to it. banking risk management will undergo a major change from what it looks now, as there will be new challenges for the business. customers want real-time service and update, which will require huge investments in technology and artificial intelligence. there would be pressure on banks to provide real-time services with a reduced cost (affecting bank margins). with the financial crises day on day, new regulatory norms are introduced, maintaining a strict check on liquidity and capital adequacy. the bank needs to invest in proper it infrastructure which is not only reliable but also flexible. upcoming fintech startups will also add on to the strategic risk of the banks. not to forget the cyber risk which will become one of the top risks for banks in the coming decade.to cope with the above risks, banks need to put more robust and reliable risk management in place. by the end of this decade, or even earlier, the active approach of the financial institutions in handling the risk functions will determine its success or failure. they need a have proactive approach in identifying, assessing and mitigating risk through better it infrastructure, machine intelligence, better resources allocation/mapping, real-time analytics, and internal control frameworks. however, one can bet that the future will belong to those who will have a go-ahead approach in identifying, assessing and putting effective risk minimization plan to actions.","['buying', 'share', 'playing',

74,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/future-of-bank-risk-management/,The Future of Bank Risk Management - Blackcoffer Insights,"in the past decade, there has been a fundamental change in the daily operations of the bank. with completely aiming to transform the operations digitally, the banks especially the private banks have invested a lot in technology to reduce manual labor and to create a more streamlined process. however, this has exposed the banks to unwanted new risks. while banks take a strategic risk aversion strategy to minimize risk, the phases they have been through are restored -> rationalize -> reinvent, they have clearly marked only the first phase of restore through strict regulations and compliances from the regulating bodies both in india and internationally. making it clear that we are far away from seeing the risk-free banking utopia. risk management is not the same as risk avoidance. it is about making risk-informed decision to diminish the probability of it affecting the bank. in the long term, it talks about sustained growth. and while processing these risks they must make sure that no new risk is created.history has always been a keen teacher in reflecting our faults. the 2008 financial crisis has been one of the biggest eye-openers for banks. through its inception, even the bassel norms in 2012 underwent a huge change pertaining to different banking risks such as the supervision risk, operational risk, and liquidation risk. in the present when we are opening banking to a more digital platform it is more vulnerable to risks both old and new risks. some of the contemporary risks would include cybersecurity risk and privacy risk. with the digital transformation setting, it is imperative that different banks would undergo disruption to create a unique model or an example to follow. by being the first to adopt the new technologies makes them the first to be exposed to vulnerability. to gain more attraction for customers banks are trying to highlight their easy to use services accessible from home. when it comes to banks the future is a double-edged sword. after all, the banks are involved in the nitty-gritty and the economy of the system, failure of which can reduce the nation into rubbles. for banks, this means a certain level of changes needs to be made into the system such as:tightening regulations on both the banking system and its employeesaligning customer expectations and risk aversion to changing technologyremoving biases arising from human intervention in risk management by introducing digital networks.banks have only just started to realize the problems arising from these new risks. while they are trying to minimize problems pertaining to a cyber security risk, credit risk, and operations risk, they have yet to realize other kinds of risks that are influenced by external factors and directly or indirectly harm the bank management system. prominent amongst these are the geopolitical and socio-political risk that arises due to the global penetration of banks in different cultures and countries without trying to adapt to the local situations. they might seem trivial, but the macroeconomic conditions guided by politics and regulations in a new emerging market can make or break the bank. the near future seems direr. with any bank coming with the prospectus of being in the game for indefinite years, they are more at risk with a potentially long-term effect on customer acquisition and customer service, two vital features in todays banking prerogative for tomorrows banking. with upcoming technologies like the internet of things and artificial intelligence or human factors like population growth and mass migration, the long-term risk will be huge enough to outweigh the short gains got from managing short term risks. these may be caused due to reputational risk or conduct risk which as a non-metric risk is not quantifiable but are totally dependent on how banks portray themselves.over the years, banks have been provided with several regulations to create failsafe measures to avoid these risks. however, as banks advance and are trying to get more competitive, it has become imperative that the risks also differs. banks must become more cautious and adopt new practical methods different from their rudimentary ways to counter them. a good risk management system is one that can support the banks abilities to react to short term risk all the while circumventing itself from long term risk that may occur sooner or later. such efficiency is important because it can devise new operations and talent models to better cover risk without doing irredeemable damage. but its not just the system that needs to be efficient but the role professional plays is equally important. there is a need to have better decision-making capabilities that balance the gains with the losses incurred. all in all, a good risk management technique is one that can sense the disruption in technology and can adapt itself in a reliable system to minimize damage both in the short term and in the long term.

75,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/advanced-analytics-redefining-banking/,How advanced analytics are redefining banking? - Blackcoffer Insights,"the banking industry is going through a transformational journey with the comprehensive usage of advanced analytics algorithms in day to day business of core banking. customer acquisition through various channels, existing customer engagement, predicting defaulters on credit card or loan applications, etc are few of the areas where analytics is doing a tremendous job. i will explain some scenarios from my past experience of working in the advanced analytics team of a leading multinational bank where we had used some interesting concepts from analytics and machine learning to solve complex business problems.customer is god (or is it so?) it is impossible to track god, but you can track your potential customers with the help of advanced analytics algorithms. a lot of information about their buying patterns, demographics, transactions, service requests, etc are available with banks. this is being used efficiently to predict the propensity of a customer buying a specific product. while working in the analytics department, i collaborated with many sales teams which needed a rank-ordered list of potential future customers for direct mailer/cold calling campaigns. the campaigns usually contain an attractive offer specific to the product, like lower interest rate for a credit card, higher interest on savings account, etc. which are hedged by confidence that the significant number of customers from the ranked list would be up for buying the product, as opposed to the ones being contacted randomly. not only potential customers for a product, but also which customers are having the mindset to close their account (customer attrition) is being predicted.data science algorithms such as logistic regression work well in predicting the probability of customer propensity to buy or customer attrition probability. for example, consider the below real-life business problem:a leading mnc bank wants to formulate a strategy to curb the
customer attrition, which is constantly on the rise, for their savings account
product. they reach out to the advanced analytics department to help them in
retaining their best customers by predicting which one of them is having a
propensity towards closing their account so that they can connect with them and
offer attractive offers to continue their invaluable relationship.the advanced analytics team starts with first narrowing down
the problem and defining attrition, for eg- customers taking out their parked
money, closing their savings account, and not reinvesting their money with
another product offered by the same bank. the business wants to predict
attrition 3 months in advance to get sufficient time to design a retention
strategy.the team then moves on to collect the required data, which usually takes up most of the time in the project as questions like which data to collect, for how much time period, what additional data is needed, etc. are very critical requirements. once the stage is set, the data scientists perform their final act machine learning. the algorithms will read the data and find out patterns leading to attrition behavior based on previous account closures. it will then leverage this learning on newly available customer information in the current scenario and predicts the probability of attrition.i came across an astounding project predicting customer propensity to buy retail banking products 10 years from today! guess what was the driving feature in these algorithms? thats right, current educational background and achievements tracked on business social media websites lead to understanding where the person would want to park their money in the future.one very interesting use of natural language processing algorithms like nave bayes classifier in retail banking is into analyzing transactions. each transaction is associated with a code and a short description. data scientists use language parsing to extract keywords or tokens from the humongous text generated to read through the description and discover more about the transaction. it can be identified whether you have paid for a product at a retail store, transferred money to another bank account that you hold or paid the bill of a credit card from another bank. the transactions can be then linked to how you value your current relationship with the bank and the business can decide upon various customer outreach strategies based on this critical information.they buy what they see according to the laws of economics, choices spoil us. the more the options in front of customers, the more confused they become and the more chances of not buying the product. a very niche field that makes use of hardcore machine learning algorithms is targeted digital marketing, and retail banking is constantly using this to identify and catch potential customers visiting the website by displaying customized web content which caters to the needs of visitors and offer products they are looking for. how does the business know what the customer wants? digital footprints!millions of website visitors generate thousands of gbs of data that contain information such as what channel they come from, which is the most frequent landing page on the banks website, which pages they scan through, how much time they spend reading the content, how many unique visits they make per day or week etc. this data is called the digital footprint of a website visitor, also called clickstream data. banking and financial institutions have been churning this data to generate accurate information about what exactly the visitor is looking for, and they efficiently display customized content to the visitors with products that they would be interested in displayed on the home page. this prompts the visitor to click on the display link and understand more about the product, as the saying goes, they buy what they see. you should not display too much content altogether as it will confuse the visitor and they might log off without making any deal, or without leaving their information to be contacted later. the information from digital footprints can be customized to the extent of what % rate the visitor would convert on! customized content is displayed based on which current visitors show characteristics of other visitors in the past who got converted. since the conversion rate is minimal as only a few out of millions of visitors on the banks website actually buy a product or service online, we need to use some very powerful machine learning algorithms that can catch the pattern with the limited amount of data to learn on. also, there is a huge amount of data that needs to be read through by the algorithm as digital footprints get generated with each second. machine learning algorithms such as random forest (which use bagging methodology) or gradient boosting (which use boosting methodology) come to the rescue. these algorithms are efficient in handling huge amount of data and can identify patterns with good accuracy. data scientists also use a technique called stacking where outputs of different algorithms are combined and fed into another model to calculate probability as a combination of various machine learning algorithms.so, the next time you visit a banks website and pop-up displays offering an attractive interest rate on the home loan, be assured that a heavily loaded machine learning algorithm running in the background has monitored your activity on the website and knows what you are looking for. clustering the one stop shop for analytics solutionsmajority of decision making in banks and financial
institutions is done by dividing things into groups that have similar
characteristics and behave in a particular way, so that decisions may be
applied in batches which saves time, energy and of course money. clustering
algorithms to the rescue! i cannot count the number of times we proposed clusters
as a solution to a business problem but would share two instances i distinctly
remember where we did so.the first one was for a bank which wanted to identify its most loyal customers from, well, not so loyal. our approach was to define loyalty based on three metrics: recency of transactions, frequency of transactions and the monetary value of transactions (better known as rfm model in analytics world). these three metrics combined, with a certain weight assigned to each one based on what is more important to the business, enable us to rank which customers are interacting more as compared to others (who eventually are dormant and fall in not so loyal category). an important consideration is to study the transactions in depth otherwise errors might creep in. for instance, and this is very interesting, when we developed the categories based on rfm score, we saw every single savings account holder scored very high on recency value. this was very intriguing for us and we spent days in identifying what was happening, only to later realize that every savings account has an interest receivable by the account holder, and it credits to the account at the end of each month. the trade-offs of being too technical i suppose.the second instance was when the business wanted to identify bank branches that have lower than average performance, on metrics like new customers acquired, average balances maintained in accounts, quality of home loan applications sent to head branch for approval, promoter score of customers, employee attrition, etc. using k-means clustering, we identified and differentiated all the high performing branches on these metrics from the lower ones. this helped the bank in taking decisions like reviewing the financial targets for lower performing branches or provide focus on employee training, and also incentivize the high performing branches to inspire others.the core idea behind all advanced analytics and data science algorithms is to help the business make better decisions faster. they say data is the new oil, and analytics is the process of converting oil to fuel.blackcoffer insights 9.0, chirag soni, iim, bangalore","['banking', 'industry', 'going', 'transformational', 'journey', 'comprehensive', 'usage',

76,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/marketing-analytics-needs/,Marketing Analytics - Why do we care about it? - Blackcoffer Insights,"to completely understand about marketing analytics and why do we care about it, we must first clear our basics like:what is marketing analytics?marketing analytics is a study of process and technology that enable marketers to analyze data and metrics to determine the dynamics of a special market within a special industry and also help in understanding the impact and measure performance based on marketing activities. it uses the important measure to maximize roi and identify the areas of improvement, overall marketing effectiveness.source: marketing analytics?as businesses expand into a new market, new technologies were adopted to support them. diverse technologies were implemented across several platforms in order for companies to advertise., market and clear brand awareness. as a marketer, along with your long task list, you need to be conversant with every new marketing medium that is introduced. but how do you know which of your efforts are making a difference? is the new platform or new technology that you just signed-up for even bringing in any results? companies need to analyze data from a combination of channels where marketing activity was carried out. this permits them to be sure about campaign performance. but initially, marketers were only checking for data and deciding about campaign success. you cant rely on guesswork or gut feeling to be successful in this era of marketing. you need to back up the feasibility of every activity with facts and figures. it helps you understand which marketing activities are bringing in revenue. marketing analytics eliminated this roadblock by facilitating data scrutiny across all channels. stakeholders now had enhanced clarity about product performance. marketing analytics was revolutionary in changing the marketing dynamic.steps of marketing analytics success1. find your objective and create strategy:before the marketing analytics, the company should design a bright strategy based on the company objectives. several tools are available in the digital marketplace that allows companies to construct tailor-made campaigns which revolve around their product and help them find their company objectives in the market.these tools center around search engine audience sentiment about popular keywords, trends, popular hashtags among many others. by building a campaign that includes these words marketers can place their bets for a campaign victory.the strategy is the key and depending on brand perception, platforms that resonate the product should be engaged in the campaign. once the campaign is launched, back-end analytic tools come into the picture. these tools will allow marketers to check for various aspects that encapsulate the digital marketing spectrum like conversions, incoming leads, website traffic, etc.2. determine a data model:vast amounts of data get generated during the campaigning process which can be converted into meaningful insights. marketers need to ensure that they have covered and collated data elements getting generated from all the sources which were involved in a marketing campaign. the data generated would be unstructured.a model consists of columns in a spreadsheet and calculation used to give you results or metrics. this is the perfect time to understand what data you have to work with and to possibly bring in an experienced analyst to assist with questions. you may have more to work with than you initially thought, so its best to lay it all out.this data can later be structured by the use of several tools to get transparency about how customers are shopping today. with an increasing number of people buying products on their mobile phones, entrepreneurs are trying to make shopping as rapid as possible for this group of buyers. omnichannel e-commerce platforms are also the rage.3.the scope of marketing analytics:just like data analysis can give specific insights, the overall scope of marketing analytics can be put in a nutshell by these functions.assessing marketing campaigns:marketing analytics tools provide precise information about campaign performance along with determining areas of improvement if any and predicting how they would perform in the future.competitor assessment:tools help to understand if the competitor campaign is doing better and why it is doing better. it helps to understand what competitors are doing right and if they are using certain channels that might garner more campaign success.assessing the company that has initiated the marketing campaign:finally, it allows you, the campaign originator to reflect as an organization if the marketing resource allocation is appropriate or not. it also helps in understanding the next steps that need to be taken allowing to reshuffle priorities. lastly, it helps to understand if money and time are being immersed in the right marketing mediums.4.use a balanced assortment of analytics techniques:to get the most benefit from marketing analytics, you need an analytic assortment that is balanced that is, one that combines techniques for:reporting on the past.by using marketing analytics to report on the past, you can answer such questions as which campaign elements generated the most revenue last quarter? how did an email campaign a perform against direct mail campaign b? how many leads did we generate from blog post c versus social media campaign d?analyzing the present.marketing analytics enables you to determine how your marketing initiatives are performing right now by answering questions like: how are our customers engaging with us? which channels do our most profitable customers prefer? who is talking about our brand on social media sites, and what are they saying?predicting and/or influencing the future.marketing analytics can also deliver data-driven predictions that you can use to influence the future by answering such questions as: how can we turn short-term wins into loyalty and ongoing engagement? how will adding 10 more sales people in under-performing regions affect revenue? which cities should we target next using our current portfolio?5.create actionable reporting and fill in the gaps:marketing organizations have access to a lot of different analytic capabilities in support of various marketing goals, but if youre like most, you probably dont have all your bases covered. assessing your current analytic capabilities is a good next step. after all, its important to know where you stand along the analytic spectrum, so you can identify where the gaps are and start developing a strategy for filling them in.for example, a marketing organization may already be collecting data from online and pos transactions, but what about all the unstructured information from social media sources or call-center logs? such sources are a gold mine of information, and the technology for converting unstructured data into actual insights that marketers can use exists today. as such, a marketing organization may choose to plan and budget for adding analytic capabilities that can fill that particular gap. of course, if youre not quite sure where to start, well, thats easy. start where your needs are greatest, and fill in the gaps over time as new needs arise.6.apply learning and validate:there is absolutely no real value in all the information marketing analytics can give you unless you act on it. in a constant process of testing and learning, marketing analytics enables you to improve your overall marketing program performance by, for example: identifying channel deficiencies. adjusting strategies and tactics as needed. optimizing processes. gainingcustomer insight.without the ability to test and evaluate the success of your marketing programs, you would have no idea what was working and what wasnt, when or if things needed to change, or how. by the same token, if you use marketing analytics to evaluate success, but you do nothing with that insight, then what is the point?applied holistically, marketing analytics allows for better, more successful marketing by enabling you to close the loop as it relates to your marketing efforts and investments. for example, marketing analytics can lead to bettersupply and demand planning,price optimization, as well as robust lead nurturing and management, all of which leads to more revenue and greater profitability. by more effectively managing leads and being able to tie those leads to sales which is known as closed-loop marketing analytics you can see which specific marketing initiatives are contributing to your bottom line.conclusion","['completely', 'understand',

in the era of growing usages of big data, managers and leaders in private companies and the government should be data-driven. they must avoid using hit and trial basis of work and rather do what the data states. this needs a change in mindset from using the traditional way of doing the work manually and effective training is needed to make decisions based on data-driven. though businesses have tried hard to adopt data and analytics in different forms efficiently to boost business efficiency and personalize offerings, governments have been laggards. the possible benefits that data analytics could bring to the government could vary from transforming the programs of the government like using big data and analytics where data is more complex for human interface to interpret and empowering citizens thereby to boost transparency and to enable participation of all stakeholders.the government in a big data worldgovernments differ from businesses when it comes to goals, mission, and decision making. though decision-makers in businesses are limited there is a diverse set in government. the government has tremendous data in legacy databases collected from various sources and forms that must be curated and migrated for new-age analytic tools. further, data collection is a paramount task for the government since data is received from numerous online and offline channels. data sharing and retaining it between departments and across ministries is a challenge, provided the existing jurisdictional boundaries.
data analytics when properly managed could be a blessing for the government struggling to gain bigger insights about any particular projects or for the future course of action for an economy as a whole. however, it could also be a curse to the organizations and governments that are not prepared to handle the untold x-bytes of unstructured data pouring unceasingly into their coffers. this is the dilemma most companies wake up to every day, and thus they capture only a fraction of the value that data analytics brings. realizing the essence of digital advancement, big data could have a huge impact only when used on a massive scale, with safeguards by the government for the delivery of public services and goods. every government agency should adopt big data technology for reducing corruption, threat, and challenges and increasing efficiency, accountability, and transparency which will help to become themselves transparent, accountable, and hassle-free public agencies.

collection of data and applying data analytics to measure the effect being achieved or not. for example, through the advent of government initiatives like digital india, an infrastructure has been set up so that all the governments services are made available to deliver services online by leveraging the internet and information technology. political leaders in several states of india have started adopting these technologies for real-time governance across the state to help better address analytical requirements that facilitate state-level decision-making. for example, the andhra pradesh government has used digital technology in every department and has launched real-time monitoring where the chief minister monitors the performance of each department through cm office real-time executive (core) dashboard as the data is updated automatically. another such example is in the state of odisha, where lpg distribution center was opened in areas, which needed them the most and not where lpg companies see the most demand that was done using geospatial analytics. also, many not-for-profit development organizations like, swaniti initiative is working on innovative projects on analyzing data for the indian government. they collect, analyze, and visualize data, which is used to design the development programs. they partnered with the andhra pradesh cms office to provide the data insights on agriculture that helped design a seed dissemination program.so our political leaders can play an important role in providing effective governance if they leverage these new technologies. adoption of these big data and analytics can play a major role in the overall development of society. these political leaders can take advantage of the power of it infrastructure in their respective areas and can use the technology of big data to bring in transparency and accountability in governance. there are many other government institutions and departments like the income-tax department that can use data analytics to scan through income and expenditure patterns of tax return filers and use it to detect black money generation. similarly, such tools can also be used to detect terror and crime financing by analyzing the pattern of transactions being done through respective accounts. as tax collection is the major source of income for the government, they can strengthen the it department with these technologies to counter the tax evasion problems faced by the government and trace the loopholes in the system. also, they can create a team of data scientists for several departments of government to keep track of functions and administrations so that everyone can come under the lens of performance check with data-based results. artificial intelligence-based systems can be used for fraud detection in several government institutions and hence can act upon that also within time to avoid further setbacks.another example where these systems can be used extensively are in the areas of land and property holding records to detect fraud and forging of documents as most of the documents related to properties are still paper-based, hence it needs to be strengthened through advanced big data and analytics systems to keep a proper track record. also, it can be used in our judicial system to track the number of pending cases as well as important cases that have been pending for a long time and yet not resolved. further, it can be used for tracking the healthcare facilities and monitoring their performance through artificial intelligence and data analytics like what is the quality of treatment and facilities being offered to the people in these state-run hospitals and whether the government spending on healthcare is actually utilized or not effectively.now, these things can be achieved if these political leaders try to inculcate the data-driven decision-making practices in their processes. for this, first, they need to invest more in setting up more data warehouses so that data can be collected and stored as well as bring more data scientists to work on these areas so that administration can be monitored in real-time and government can function on data-based results. as the government spends lots of money on several schemes for public welfare, the effectiveness of these schemes plays a major role in helping society also. also, the government can partner with several institutions as well as companies working in these fields to provide solutions as well as collaborative research can be done to find the solutions for these real-world problems. many political parties had already used data analytics in their electoral campaign program to understand the voter stance of a particular demographic and have campaigned accordingly, which has resulted in a better outcome for the electoral results, for example, the 2014 lok sabha elections was a prime example of using data-driven techniques for electoral campaigning. so the political leaders also now understand the benefits of using these technologies in decision making and hence if they create an infrastructure to use it on a larger scale in day-to-day governance, a lot of work can be fast-tracked and hence, ease them in administration also. today, perhaps india owns the largest data repository in the world gathered via digitalization of records for purposes like aadhaar card, passports, pan card, kisan credit card, etc. there is a massive amount of data that government has and if they use it positively then there is a lot of opportunities to apply this data to improve the citizens service experience and government efficiency, especially in the delivery of services to the common people.this can also be applied to the farming sector, whereby water demand can be predicted in needy areas having a higher reliance on agriculture and producing in large amounts. water supply problems soon can also be predicted. data analytics can be used to get farmers a better price for their agricultural produce by producing crops having higher expected demand or avoiding crops which will have higher failure probability. in the education sector, it can be used to predict the demand for the number of schools, teachers, reading materials, etc. in areas where these facilities are not in reach and their performance can also be monitored by the respective district departments.so basically these technologies have a wide application in major areas like healthcare, education, transportation, agriculture, etc. and if implemented can lead to positive results in the near future in terms of better governance. but this needs to be done with proper planning and proper channels as data security is also a big concern and a data warehouse has the huge challenge of cybersecurity issues because, in case of the data breach, all the data could be affected and might lead to misuse of the data. so if our political parties could leverage these technologies in their respective areas, the benefit is huge and can help them in achieving better governance as well as greater accountability to the people.blackcoffer insights 8.0:

Insights,"politics is not a game. it is an earnest businessthe above quote by winston churchill highlights the fact that politics is not made for the light-hearted or those who are in it for fun. it is not a dreamers palace but a pit where rivals fight it out to succeed. in recent times, technology has completely changed how political leaders compete. the presence of multiple platforms, microbloggers, and hundreds of social media websites has changed the dynamics of the pit completely.data analytics was a buzzword during barack obamas election campaigns in 2008 and 2012. it is also believed that predictive models and extensive analysis of the data of us citizens helped him turn the tides in his favor in 2012. us elections post 2012 saw a decrease in traditional advertising expenditure from 93% to less than 50%. these elections also saw a man with no political experience take the reins of the most powerful country in the world. cambridge analytica (infamously known for harvesting data from facebook) was awarded the research-focused, arf ogilvy awards in the following year and the dependence of the world on data analytics was reiterated. elections are not just campaigns based on sentiments, hunches, and popular opinions; instead, influencers and digital trends lead the way in swaying masses to favor an electoral candidate.big data is considered to be empowering for political leaders. when a political leader decides to contest an election; he has terabytes of data on what opinion people have of him, what is expected of the next leader, how many people might vote for him, and most importantly what are the most pressing concerns in the society.extensive data mining and collecting data after every event has given political leaders an opportunity to adopt a modular approach and voice a different concern to different people. this has reduced the number of misfires significantly. through analytics, political leaders and their research teams have been able to categorize the entire population on the basis of psychographic segmentation.these segmentations have enabled political leaders to include personalized and tailor-made strategies to be more closely affiliated with people. every word that a political leader says is backed by algorithms which makes the delivery impeccable. this unparalleled precision is what draws political leaders to adopt data-based campaigns. social media content is now being altered accordingly as well. people with similar political interests would find similar content on social media. this content would be coherent to their interests which ensures that the user is bound to read it. when a common man is checking his notifications for early morning updates, he is being targeted by the research team of a political campaign without him realizing it.campaigns have limited financial resources. when the resources are limited, information such as the amount of contact required for a particular constituency and which population to target can help in the effective utilization of resources. a political leader can recognize constituencies that could swing either way or the ones which are a lost cause and effectively manage resources to produce favorable results.analytics firms collect huge amounts of data. algorithms are used which reveal trends, opinions, and other patterns that would have required door-to-door campaigning a few decades ago. this data also includes an analysis of social media websites. the firm uses this data to predict outcomes based on the coherency of opinions of the people with that of a political leader. the task at hand for the political leader now would be to convert more people in his favor. data will give reports of the constituencies where the vote might swing in either way. the leader capitalizes on these areas. micro-targeting potential voters were widely used during obamas campaign of 2012. this included specific tv advertisements and tailor-made social media messages to influence people. these customized campaigns have helped many leaders and their use is becoming more prominent.while on one side everything seems bright; the use of big data raises some serious concerns as well. one of the biggest concerns that have been raised is the issue of data privacy. accurate analysis requires huge volumes of good quality data. it is claimed that most of the data gathered are through primary research (surveys, polls, etc.). primary research has its limitations and there is always a risk of data being highly skewed. it has been accused that most of the data usually being gathered is secondary research data under the guise of primary data. cambridge analytica was accused of using personal data of american citizens through facebook while it was working for state senator ted cruz. scandals like these raise serious concerns about the misuse of ones data by political leaders. data manipulation is another concern that has affected elections. accusations were made on russian hackers for manipulating us presidential elections by accessing research data and private emails of electoral candidates. though these are just accusations it does not deny the fact that it might be a possibility in the future.while data has empowered political leaders, it is on them on how they choose to utilize this information. a leader can choose to hide his personal opinions and intended agendas just to maintain consistency with the masses or intentionally design a manifesto which portrays him as the most ideal candidate. amplification of malpractices which the authorities might not be able to detect in due time is a serious concern.while data is enlightening, statistical use of human preferences and equating human lives to pointers being justified is certainly food for thought. big data and analytics is a double-edged sword whose effectiveness will continue to bring more political leaders towards it and for now, the bonus of using it appropriately remains with the leaders, but the incentive to misuse it is fairly high.blackcoffer insights 8.0: shubham sabharwall, iim kashipur","['politics', 'game',

sales data, transactional data, operational data, strategic data, log data and much more. data has the potential to transform business and drive the creation of business value. data can be used for a range of simple tasks such as managing dashboards i.e. operation, strategic and analytical or visualizing relationships. however, the real power of data lies in the use of analytical tools (bi tool, r, python, excel etc.) that allow the user to extract useful knowledge and quantify the factors that impact events. some examples include customer sentiment analysis, customer churn analytics, geospatial analysis of key operation centers, workforce planning, recruiting, smart planning, or risk-sensing.analytical tools are not the discovery of the last decade, in fact, it has been there for centuries. statistical regressions and classification models have been around for the best part of the 20th century. it is, however, the explosive growth of data in our times combined with the advanced computational power that renders data analytics a key tool across all businesses and industries.in the financial industry, some examples of using data analytics to create business value include fraud detection, customer segmentation, churn prevention, insurance premium modeling, risk modeling, credit score modeling, and employee or client retention.in order for data analytics to reveal its potential to add value to the business, a certain number of ingredients need to be in place. this is particularly true in recent times with the explosion of big data (big implying data volume, velocity, and variety). some of these ingredients are the listed below:distributed file systems the analysis of data requires some sophisticated it infrastructure to support the work and motion. for large amounts of data, the market standards are platforms like apache hadoop which consists of a component that is responsible for storing the data hadoop distributed file system (hdfs) and a component responsible for the processing of the data mapreduce. surrounding this solution there is an entire ecosystem of additional software packages such as pig, hive, spark, etc. could solutions such as google cloud, aws cloud, azure and more be making the whole system way easier than it used to be before.database management an important aspect of the analysis of data is the management of the database. an entire ecosystem of database systems exists: such as relational, object-oriented, nosql-type, graph-database, neo4j, etc. well, known database management systems include sql, oracle, sybase, mongodb, graph-database. these are based on the use of a primary key to locate entries. other databases do not require fixed table schemas and are designed to scale horizontally. apache cassandra, for example, is designed with the aim to handle big data and have no single point of failure.advanced analytics ","['data', 'many', 'form', 'e', 'primary', 'data', 'secondary',

81,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-artificial-intelligence-can-deliver-real-value-to-companies-2/,How Artificial Intelligence can deliver real value to companies? - Blackcoffer Insights,"what is artificial intelligence?today we talk a lot about artificial intelligence and how it will change our future. but we dont know what it actually means. let us see what is artificial intelligence.artificial intelligence was coined in the 1950s as a task which is performed by a machine with the intelligence a human can use to complete the task. in layman language, it acts a situation in the same manner in which a human would act. if the human can answer to a question in a conversation, so would ai can. it analyses the information and makes future decisions, in the same way in which a human would.ai basically works on an algorithm. it uses a computers intellect to solve the problem quicker and more accurate than a human can. ai mostly consists of statistical information to find trends and patterns in the data. ai can perform various functions like analyzing, planning, problem-solving and learning. another part of ai is machine learning, which gathers information, learns and adapts as it accumulates new data.stages of artificial intelligencethe artificial intelligence consists of three main stages.artificial narrow intelligence:this is the first stage of ai as it functions narrowly. it functions like an infant baby where it covers only one functional area. ani can be used in the best manner when you have to use it in a reparative manner. it is very cost saving as we do not need to hire any human and pay him on a monthly or weekly basis.artificial general intelligence:this is the stage which is the biggest achievement in the entire humanity as it covers a broad area in the technological space. humans have finally constructed a machine which not just think but also has the reasoning ability. with agi, machines now have an ability similar to humans. machines have become capable of doing things which are performed by humans. agi is working with governments and organizations in problem-solving and abstract thinking also. however, it is still in evolution and it will take some time to replace all the abilities of a human and work parallelly with him. but with this can humans sustain?artificial super intelligence:asi is the final stage of artificial intelligence as predicted by the scientists in which machines will automate the tasks where average human intelligence is used. if ai reaches that stage it will not only discover the mysteries of the universe but also able to solve the problems which are not discovered by mankind right now.how ai is building a business model?ai has narrowed the gap between businesses and technology, it reduced the burden of tasks on skilled individuals and it has helped in easing decision making processes. the traditional it methods, which are solving precise, specific and repetitive problems have reduced the business and technology to one of user and tool. ais powerful reasoning and contextualizing ability are now making businesses to be more proactive with their forecasts and solutions.traditionally where a business model is forcing humans to define rules for machines to follow, ai has derived its own rules from data which is provided to it. this has led to businesses taking less time to ask questions and more time to act on the answers. the time which skilled labor used to take in modifying their tools to ensure their inferences are correct, the more time can be spent on working proactively on solutions for their businesses. ai will not replace the workers but ai will add value to their skills with which they can leverage their businesses.the self-healing and adaptable power of ai programs will help management to stop worrying about the logistics of data and to start thinking on ways to leverage this power to discover the areas which were impossible to explore because off less time or insufficient information.in todays technological world businesses are about to shift from more reliance of human decisions, less forecasting errors and few necessities for subjective management calls will help organizations with improved ability to predict and respond accurately to customer and clients needs.how ai revolutionizing areas of business?artificial intelligence is not just limited to top multinationals anymore, a lot of rapidly growing small and medium enterprises (sme) are entering into the ai market. it is predicted by research firm spiceworks that around 30% of the businesses will embrace ai by the end of 2018, an increase from just 13% in 2017. rapidly growing ai-based technologies are driving development in nearly every sector. as we move ahead, ai will make sure businesses have incorporated these five areas.marketingmachine learning algorithms can predict more accurate results than humans. the ability of artificial intelligence to analyze data to increase sales is one of the lucrative features many marketing firms are using. ai algorithm can drive through a large volume of user data to find trends and patterns, which will revolutionize the ways companies do effective marketing and help to leverage the content strategy. a recent harvard report has shown analyzing chat logs for words and phrases can build successful sales by as much as 54%.search engines like google trends can help in capturing the trends of a particular product category with times with the help of keywords. social media activity can provide ai algorithms like amazons recommendation system with enough user data to analyze purchasing trends of individual users. jeff wilke, ceo of amazon of the worldwide consumer, uses behavioral-tracking ai algorithms in place of traditional memory-based marketing algorithms. ai can help companies with their pricing strategies- ai can track price trends of a product category for higher profit margins.human resource applicationsmachine learning algorithms can automate various tasks of human workers, freeing time, resources and money for businesses. while critiques say that this as a start of robots taking over humans and loss of jobs for humans, most businesses tend towards a more practical view.ai is a perfect complement to the human resources of a company. the technology will reduce the burden on administrative functions of a company, allowing its workers to focus more on creative and engaging work in more essential areas. according to richard branson, companies must empower their people to make on the spot decisions and think on their feet. employees efforts and talent can be used more efficiently by freeing them from traditional tasks.emotional analysishuman emotions can be very complex to measure for ai, but the technology has surprised everyone with an application called emotional analysis. the use of surveys, social media, image recognition software and lots of other techniques, some ai algorithms are dedicated completely to analyze human perspectives on a host of topics with more reliability.the emotional analysis will enable companies to predict consumer behavior. the emotional analysis technology was used for pm narendra modis election campaign to judge peoples opinion towards policies of the upa government. using ai algorithms, companies can decide their marketing campaign in a changing market.business operations efficiencydaily operations of a business can be improved with the help of ai algorithms, resulting in higher growth of the business. ai algorithms can analyze areas of supply chain and workflows to identify the improvements in business. a streamlined workflow will result in effective utilization of the companys resources and it will reduce the costs due to low response time, maintenance and redundancy will be minimized.with ai in place, manufacturing firms can streamline their daily operations. forbes magazine reported that with the integration of ai the production capacity rose to 20 percent and a drop in materials used for manufacturing operations by 4 percent, improving business operational efficiency.artificial intelligence tools before making the investment in ai algorithm, it is necessary for companies to have all the tools required for the better functioning of ai algorithms. proper estimation of the internet speed must be done and the type of professionals required an additional cost that may incur in the future.
for optimum use of ai, it is not necessary to hire a data scientist to integrate it with business. a large number of companies are making user-friendly ai tools for entrepreneurs and small medium enterprises (smes). one of the examples is an ai-powered application called grammarly is helping businesses with consistent, high-quality writing across the companys brand, while a tool called legal robot is helping companies in developing clear and compliant contracts and legal documents.
a number of companies are using predesigned chatbots for customer services and in employee training programs. ai-powered chatbots have improved natural language processing to a large extent, which is leading to utilizing for them in customer services. the use of chatbots has reduced response times for human service agents.
conclusion
although machine learning and artificial intelligence have incorporated into businesses, their full potential is still not being explored. ai although being used by many organizations it is still in the nascent stage and will take time to develop to its full potential. early adoption of ai will help companies to sustain by predicting trends and taking corrective actions. the limitless applications of ai will provide companies with opportunities to innovate and differentiated in the competition.

82,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/the-prospective-recipe-of-success-in-the-age-of-analytics/,The Prospective Recipe of Success in the Age of Analytics - Blackcoffer Insights,"as you sow, so you reap, because god watches everything. i often wonder if god is not really the god but just a person with infinite life and great acumen for analytics. because then only he would be able to predict and manipulate our future based on our actions. i am not an atheist; its just that i couldnt find a better metaphor to depict the power of analytics. analytics is a way of interpreting and communicating relevant and meaningful patterns in data. thus, it is obvious that for the existence of analytics, it requires data. now, the good news is that data is everywhere; every single human impression, online or offline, is data. but, the bad news is that it is extremely difficult to filter out the relevant information from the ocean of data.well, for a relief, analytics is getting evolved to take care of this issue as well. the answer of the evolved analytics, to the issue of finding relevant data, is web 3.0 (embedded in artificial intelligence). in simple words, if you are searching for particular information, lets say about a word adam which could be anything, a name, any brand, a restaurant or whatsoever; web 3.0 will analyze your location, your interests through your impressions on the internet and on the basis of them, it will show the results for the word adam that are most relevant to you.the companies, these days, find the positioning of their products and brands the most crucial and challenging task. with a myriad of similar brands, with similar offerings, it is really difficult to make a dominant impression on the minds of the consumers. after, digital platforms coming into the picture, the power has passed into the hands of the consumers. from the selection of delivery channels, selection of communication channels to the selection of payment methods, every component in the distribution channel is an offering bundled with the actual product/service. thus, companies are leveraging the attributes of the distribution channels as the point of differentiation to stand out in the horde of brands. in order to control and optimize these attributes, the brands are trying to decipher the behavior of the consumers and their preferences by critically analyzing their on-site and in-store buying patterns. this need of the marketers has led to the introduction of what we call the age of analytics. so, let us look at some great and unique ways in which analytics has helped the firms to accurately analyze and predict consumer buying behavior.let us design this recipe of success by fragmenting analytics into its different kinds, and then explaining the role of each fragment in designing the business plan for any firm. so, depending upon the field of analysis and the objective of analysis, analytics can be largely fragmented into predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, descriptive analytics, retail analytics, store assortment, and stock-keeping unit optimization, marketing optimization and marketing mix modeling, web analytics. now, let us look at the different stages involved in the designing of a business plan for any firm and the right kind of analytics to be applied for that particular stage.industry analysis: understanding the battlegroundit is important to analyze the industry in which the firm is operating. one cannot compare the sales of a geo-textile manufacturing company with a company that manufactures biscuits. thus analyzing the industry standards is the first and foremost step towards developing a successful business plan.for this stage, the firm needs descriptive analytics tools which can interpret the past data of the industry into meaningful patterns and trends which are easier to study. also, the industry standards must be converted into measurable terms so as to define a reference point for the firm.determining internal competencies: understanding the power of selfbefore entering into the battleground, a firm must be aware of its own strengths and weaknesses. weakness is a term that can transform the fate of a firm. a company which is aware of what not to do is better than a company which knows what to do.the descriptive analytics will again come into the play but in a different context. now, the approach will company-centric. this will include determining the infrastructural and customer service capabilities of the firm and the external opportunities and threats to the firm from the data obtained through primary and secondary research techniques.understanding the consumersthe center of every business plan is the consumer. thus, understanding their needs and preferences becomes an urgent requirement for the business plan. the answer to this urgency is predictive analytics.predictive analytics takes the past buying behavior and buying a pattern of the consumers as the input for the analysis. the key tasks are to predict the perceived value of the offerings in the minds of consumers, the consumer involvement with the product and the factors influencing the consumers buying behavior.competition: understanding the rivalsfrom the industry analysis only, one can draw a rough idea about the best performing firms in the industry and a bit about their positioning strategies. but this is not enough. determining the secret ingredient of their recipe is the key motive of conducting competitors analysis.the task is difficult. thus it requires a synergy of descriptive as well as predictive analytics.with the help of the trends and patterns designed through descriptive analytics, the firm has to predict the key competencies, the target segment, and the promotion strategies of its competitors.plan the strategyafter doing the complete background check of the industry, the competitors, and the company itself, it is time to act. the action plan has to be comprehensive, feasible, measurable, and well directed towards the goal of the company.prescriptive analytics serves the purpose of this stage. the results from the past analyses will serve as the input data for this stage. in this stage, the firm will make strategies for market optimization, brand assortment, stock keeping unit optimization, marketing mix modeling and communication channel strategy.implement the strategy implementation is a crucial phase. a company implements a strategy at a large level may be national or at times at the global level. thus, to track the data becomes the most challenging task in this phase.
now, why is the data so important? well, a business cycle never ends; incremental development is the key to survival in the market. thus, to measure the success of the strategy, to accurately predict the consumer behavior for future strategies, for retaining the consumers through post-purchase strategies, a company must manage its data very wisely. measuring the success in the planning phase, the well-directed objectives were set, and the decisions were made with assigned parameters (or kpis) to measure the success of the plan. in the implementation phase, a large amount of data is collected representing the actual reaction of the consumers towards the companys strategy. now, in the measurement phase, the actual reaction of the consumers will be put against the expected reaction. for managing such a large quantity of data, big data analytics is the solution.
after the measurement phase, the company will have a clear picture of what went wrong and what went right. this will build the base of the companys future strategies. analytics has made things simpler and complex at the same times. on one side, where analytics provides simple solutions for designing a better business plan, at the same time it is making the competitions more intense and competitors more unpredictable. in the end, the things that have always created a difference are intuition and self-belief, and analytics is meant just to provide a basis for those beliefs and inner feelings.

83,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/using-people-analytics-to-drive-business-performance/,Using People Analytics To Drive Business Performance - Blackcoffer Insights,"according to jack welch (legendary ceo), people related decisions have a huge impact on an organizations success and failure. traditionally these decisions were largely based on intuitions and biases but now there is a use of data and analytics tools to inform decisions about how to manage people. big companies like teach for america and google adopted this technique and started using workplace data to build better employees. professional sports has been ahead of almost the entire non-sports world in using these tools because its whole existence is based on the performance of individuals.hard data is used to make soft-skill decisions about hiring and talent development. it can be done on the basis of performance evaluation by figuring out how hard people are working based on analyzing the outcomes by them because we tend to judge people on an outcome and not process but the fundamental challenge in this is a range of outcomes can occur due to factors outside the employees control. so this is a challenge, separating skill from the luck. for instance, if the performance measure is pretty high on the good outcomes scale, then you can be quite confident that it is because of high effort. but it can also be a low effort with favorable environmental factors that resulted in a good outcome as a consequence. unless theyre in a very similar situation, it is difficult to compare them to one another. these type of situation need a detailed analysis to drive business performance. also in this, they try to test the people based on their persistence level because skills persist, chance doesnt persist.regression to mean is also one of the best method suggested by whartons top professors. for instance, if you sample, say, a persons running speed and then look at what their language ability is. the fastest runners, almost by definition, will not necessarily be the people with the best language ability. but thats not because theres some inverse relationship between language and running ability. its that these two traits are simply imperfectly correlated and so when you sample them on the extreme you have to expect regression to the mean on any other attribute.it is very important to choose the sample data, especially small samples. for instance, where are you most likely to see the dramatically higher percentage of boys than girls or vice-versa, born on any given day? a smaller or larger hospital? the small hospital, of-course could see large variations because you might have all girls in one day, all the boys on another day in a small hospital. theres no way you have that in a larger hospital. this means that we should be very careful to not follow our intuition on what it means when we look at small sample because they might not be the true representation of the whole data. so this is a place where data can make big difference in as opposed to just relying on intuition.to predict something, a higher number of people should be involved in the process so that we get a number of judgments. higher the number of judgments lead to a higher chance of coming close to the truth because of idiosyncratic errors. but this is based on a condition that opinions are independent. because in case if they are not, that would be equal to a small group of people giving judgments. so more data analysis helps in making better decisions.hiring the right people can also be effectively done by:job knowledge testscognitive ability testsstructured interviewspersonality tests (personality test is specially used in the retail sector where skill set requirement varies based on market type)recently, indias largest power producer, ntpc, has rolled out a basket of initiatives for its employees as it seeks to reposition its hr function to align with the fast-changing environment.also according to a recent study by professional network linkedin, analytics specialists are in high demand for hr roles as an increasing number of companies are turning to analytics in the past 5 years. so, all these things indicate that people analytics is a very useful tool to drive business performance.

84,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-artificial-intelligence-can-deliver-real-value-to-companies/,How Artificial Intelligence can deliver real value to companies? - Blackcoffer Insights,"for the majority of us indians, the first encounter with artificial intelligence (ai) was perhaps when arnold schwarzenegger displayed undying machismo in the terminator. unless ai & relating technology was your business, james cameron was perhaps the person who introduced ai to the indian masses and provided a reference of what ai is capable of! well, in an extremely entertaining way! the concept of ai can be termed as a wine aged well. much of the things which would have been considered as fantasies yesterday can be at least comprehended today if not already a reality.the world is aging and hence the percentage working population is rapidly declining. but the population is not and definitely not the resources available. this is specifically where artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning will play a pivotal role as they can be instrumental in adapting to latest labor dynamics, increase overall productivity, have a competitive advantage and ultimately help in survival!the timeline of the evolution of artificial intelligence, and its sister areas is illustrated via the below graphic:(source: nvidia, statista)the role of artificial intelligence is to ease human life and bring in incremental changes in processes involving human life. the role of artificial intelligence is perhaps best explained by andrew ng, the co-founder of google brain and coursera, the online mooc pioneer. he says the industrial revolution freed humanity from much repetitive physical drudgery; i now want ai to free humanity from repetitive mental drudgery, such as driving in traffic.the automotive industry was perhaps the first industry to realize the potential of ai and united states and japan, the two warhorses of automobiles post-wwii era were perhaps the first countries to actually work towards realizing this potential. the new jersey factory of general motors was one of the first assembly lines to host an automotive arm. these automotive arm has now become a pre-requisite of any assembly line. the car which would have taken 2 months to build can be built within a day just because of automation. a complete ai based process would do wonders. the weakness of achilles lied in his heels while the biggest weakness of automobile industry has been humans, the very species it intends to serve. the majority of the car accidents that happen on the face of the earth have a human error in its cause. the human error may serve in the invention of penicillin but definitely does not help in making roads safer. that is where driverless cars come into the picture.let us take an example of uber (or ola or didi chuxing). what are the attributes where they lack and what are the factors that prevent maximum monetization? the answer lies in the drivers. uber has not only bore the brunt of misappropriating behaviors of its drivers but also seen drivers unionizing to get a bigger piece of the pie. the scenario of uber moving completely to autonomous driving vehicles not only increases the safety of the system but also helps in maximizing profits. although a definite possibility of the future, it will take some time to get implemented till we see level-5 autonomy vehicles being rolled out.the innovations in the healthcare industry were often restricted to digitizing and automating the manual tasks to make them easier. the machines involved were not self-learning and would doctors interpretation. but the advent of ai has restructured the healthcare industry. the next 20-30 years will see personalization of healthcare industry. diagnosis, therapy, diet, and treatment would not require doctors and would be taken care entirely by machines. where does the value lie for the companies in this? again the same cause and effect diagram is what we can imagine. ai-powered healthcare firms will eliminate a large number of middlemen which are often prone to error. the majority of the deaths caused by cancer are due to failure to detect early signs and act on it. this wont be the case if the powers of ibm watson are made available to the general public. there will be no complaints even if ibm charges a premium for it. not only this, with a doctor to patient ratio of 1:921, this specifically serves india well. as it solves the problem of accessibility and quality. this is synonymous with the recent success of reliance jio, whose success can be attributed to the one most important parameter accessibility.one of the most important problems that social media giants face today is of users leaving their platform or not staying long enough on the platform. this may be because they find the content uninteresting, irrelevant, or even because of abuses and threat to privacy. these parameters are important to these social media companies because their revenue models revolve around them.what artificial intelligence can do is curate the content for a particular user according to his liking and protect his privacy to an extent he/she demands. this will, in turn, ensure that users continue to use their platform more and more and their activity in-turn monetizes it. ai-powered companies apply machine learning techniques like logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, etc. to help companies study the buying behavior of the customer and extract maximum value out of them.another major field where artificial intelligence will create a definite value is in the field of finance and wealth management. the major problem that banks face today is dealing with the non-performing assets. what ai can do in this case is factually and accurately predict the credit risk of an entity thus minimizing the npas and maximizing the profits. other problems that many people face is of sub-par returns from their investments. artificial intelligence can ensure that a superior analysis will, in turn, give a bit of better advice to the customers. this will ensure the elimination of human emotional volatility.another impact of ai is in the field of fraud detection where anomalies and patterns are studied to detect fraud and predict fraud. paypal, the us-based payment giant implemented ai to detect and predict fraud and brought the fraud rate down to 0.32% compared to industry average of 1.32%.to summarize, artificial intelligence can deliver real value by reducing the costs of human error, human inefficiencies, content customization, increase in production rate, efficient decision making, and maybe ways which we cannot comprehend as of today.
one of the most profound impacts of artificial intelligence has been in the field of human resources, both in human resource management and the hiring processes. ai has been successful in predicting candidate attributes thus making the hiring process more efficient. this ensures that the company onboard the best company-match candidates and reduce the future inefficiencies and lag-ings. ai-powered hiring saves a ton of recruiter hours thus saving time and money. besides this ai has the capability to achieve resource optimization to achieve maximum efficiency and productivity. ai also helps in predicting capabilities of employees to map the learning path for them. this will be in-line with the bigger company strategies and will assist in developing future leadership.

85,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/big-data-analytics-through-iot-in-oil-and-gas-industry/,Big Data Analytics through IoT in Oil and Gas Industry - Blackcoffer Insights,"since the last quarter of 2014 oil prices have plummeted from $100/barrel to less than $30/barrel in 2016. currently, the oil price is hovering around $70/barrel. events such as these force the o&g companies to restructure their upstream, midstream and downstream operations. refinery shutdowns, handling various grades of crude oil, and changing environmental regulations are pushing gross refining margins down to a bare minimum. with the use of iot, refineries can plan their shutdowns, minimize their downtime, and improve safety record. in fact, refineries that have incorporated iot in their operations are known as smart refineries. iot is the next step in the evolution of the oil and gas industry. it will play a significant role in lower operating expenses and increase the reliability of the complete production plant. o&g companies around the world are now focussing on iot to increase overall efficiency and decrease non-productive time as well as costs. basically, iot covers the entire value chain of the oil and gas industry right from pinpointing the location and exploration of oil wells to refining crude oil to the transportation of oil through pipelines and trucks. from the trillions of dollars that are spent every year on exploration and production (e&p), a very small investment in iot will reap huge benefits to the entire chain of petroleum operations.preventative maintenance (pm)the o&g industry loses billions of dollars every year due to non-productive time (npt). iot could be used to help reduce npt events by using real-time data to predict breakdowns and schedule preventative maintenance. this in itself is a huge field of application of iot. preventive maintenance (pm) is continuously monitoring certain parameters of the equipment, like vibration, temperature, oil levels and those parameters which are critical to the operation of the equipment, through sensors. the sensors continuously relay real-time data to the receiver. due to this, the management can accurately determine when there is need of maintenance and the time spent on repairing the machine after it is broken down as well as the greater losses that the organization had to face due to production losses are completely eliminated. in the o&g sector, pm can be used for pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, steam traps, relief valves and all those equipment where doing instrumentation is expensive and difficult and failure of these will lead to high monetary losses. billions of dollars in savings have been achieved by industries that incorporated iot in their plants for pm. the petropiar refinery (chevron/pdvsa joint venture) in mejorador jose, barcelona, venezuela, installed predictive management software in conjunction with 4,500 hart field instruments. using these technologies enabled the refinery to increase production, reduce costs, and improve profitability.[1]smart pipelinespipelines form the transportation backbone of the o&g industry. for a refinery, there are pipeline networks which scale thousands of kilometers, through rugged lands and mountains caring for the black gold. 24*7 maintenance and supervision of pipelines, in terms of theft, leaks, and corrosion, is very important but with such a huge network this is not possible using wired technology. a pipeline leak will cause oil to leak at a very high flow rate due to the high-pressure differential created and hence immediate leak detection plays a critical role. iot along with supervisory control and data acquisition(scada) plays an immensely important role here. represented here is the schneider electric and cisco smart connected pipeline. it is an open, end-to-end solution for pipeline management that provides future-ready communication architectures for integrated, automated pipeline operations through the use of modern it technologies[2].iot has enabled companies to save millions of dollars in oil losses due to pipeline leaks or theft.asset management to increase operational efficiencya typical petrochemical industry has millions of equipment both large and small and hence it is an asset-intensive industry. the assets can range from pressure relief valves (prvs) to heat exchangers (he) to huge distillation columns (dc). identifying the efficient working of the larger equipment is easy as all the important parameters like temperature, pressure, flow, and level are wired to the dcs. it is a failure of the smaller equipment that goes unnoticed which over a period of time leads to operational inefficiency. when this smaller equipment is fitted with sensors and transformed into a thing that can send data to the cloud system we get real-time analysis of the complete operation and can quickly identify as to what the issue is.a classic example of asset management for a very critical but non-instrumented part is emersons process managements successful implementation of iot at denka singapore pte ltd., a subsidiary of denka chemical company and one of the worlds largest facilities for continuous polymerizationsteam is a very important heating utility at denka. as the steam travels through pipes it keeps on condensing after exchanging heat with the concerned process fluid and becomes condensate. this along with non-condensable gases has to be removed and that is done by steam traps. an incorrectly operating steam trap results in lower heating efficiency and escape of live steam; and with industry studies showing steam-trap failure rate in the region of 20% a year (denkas was 17%), and given hundreds or even thousands of steam traps in the typical facility, the cost consequences associated with failure are significant[3]. denkas approach towards the correction of steam traps was like other process facilities, manual checking by a contractor on an annual basis. this caused a large amount of steam to go waste which created financial as well as energy loss.to automate the laborious process of steam trap monitoring and provide far more frequent updates on the health of steam traps in the denka plant, emerson process managementarchitected and deployed a native iot solution. at the equipment level, to sense (i.e. listen for) steam leakage, emersons rosemount 708 wireless acoustic transmitters configured on a wireleshart mesh network are attached to 148 of the most critical (high pressure, high capacity) steam traps in the facility. data collected at the wirelesshart gateways are then transmitted via local telecom providers singtels 3g cellular network to analytics software (hosted on a microsoft azure cloud platform) for generation of steam trap performance reports4. the acoustic patterns of the condensate are different than the acoustic pattern of steam. it is this change that the sensor monitors and reports.some of the most fascinating facts about this iot solution are:no involvement with the plant dcs thus alleviating the common concerns of interference and security with the dcs.implementation of the iot solution is simplified as there is no connection with dcs.the complete system software, as well as sensors, is provided at no upfront capital but at a monthly service fee thus the capital expenditure is replaced by the operational expenditure.the steam traps are not analyzed at denka but at emersons sensing regional centre, thus creating no additional burden on denka.creation of a weekly extension report which contains details of the failed steam traps needing replacement.creation of a monthly savings report containing information of the steam leakage and equivalent financial loss.after implementing this solution the steam trap failure rate went down from 22% to less than 10% and steam consumption decreased by 7% which will directly impact on increasing the companys bottom line.smarter oilfield operations this is an example, of smart operations for a leading o&g service provider, taken from cognizant. the client wanted to increase efficiency and reduce operational costs for thousands of electric submersible pumps (esps). esps are lowered into boreholes to provide artificial lift when the underground pressure is too weak to force oil to the surface. the engineer needs to periodically reset each pumps motor speed to optimize production. this depends on the good conditions, such as pressure, viscosity, as well as market prices. historically, reprogramming the pump profile requires dispatching an engineer to the oilfield, which is not only a waste of time but also a costly proposition that sometimes requires helicopter travel to a dangerous land or sea location.
cognizant began optimizing the problem by conducting an end-to-end analysis of all current systems and processes, identifying opportunities to optimize software, hardware, and processes regarding esps. based on the analysis, cognizant engineers developed an iot solution to efficiently gather sensor information, analyze it to determine optimal esp settings, and program those settings over the network. using the pump software developed by cognizant, the clients engineers could recalibrate pumps over the network, like adjusting motor speed according to the data generated by the software with just a few clicks, instead of traveling to remote oilfields. this can be done for a lot of pumps at the same time thus maximizing the utilization of the oilfield as well as reducing costs. the same interface enables engineers to configure rules to prevent equipment failure for example, by shutting down equipment when drill temperature reaches 100 degrees and resuming when the temperature falls to 90 degrees[4]. based on the software the client also received alerts about impending pump failures, thus enabling him to take preventative measures before the pump fails. the repair work is much faster and unplanned breakdowns have reduced thus increasing the productive time as well as customer satisfaction. the importance of iot can be clearly understood in this case as the efficiency of operations has been greatly increased.
there is immense data being generated in the oil and gas industry and rightly tapping and understanding. this data will be beneficial.

86,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/how-big-data-and-analytics-is-helping-marketing-leaders/,How big data and analytics is shaping tomorrow for marketing leaders? - Blackcoffer Insights,"of the many similarities between big data and a marketer, one thing stands out: both have an insatiable appetite for information. if you dont know what is broken, you wont be able to fix it.in an era where the clich change is the only constant is relevant more than ever, people are looking at big data and analytics to make their decisions more data-driven. big data is evolving into a necessity for the business not just to analyze and predict future outcomes but also to create and shape them. it is slowly becoming the oxygen for a company and the companys survival, in the long run, might depend on its effectiveness in using big data.humans are not the best at expressing their needs. some human needs are so latent that people dont even realize their existence. thankfully, we no longer have to rely only on questionnaires and interviews for data collection. collecting customers preferences through their online behavioral pattern and analyzing them can provide much better results. this can be used to take the level of customization a customer experiences to a whole new level.big data provides insights into the decision journey of an individual before buying a product. the marketing team can identify the key features in the product that attract the customers. it is also indispensable in understanding the local markets and helps in coming up with marketing strategies at regional levels.fig 1. example- impact of big data and analytics on marketing strategiessource: nowadays dont want products pushed to them and would rather prefer buying stuff at their convenience. thus, it has become necessary that a high degree of customization and accuracy is required while marketing products to customers. whether a person is your customer or not may depend on that first product you recommend to him.equally important is the appropriate pricing of the product. big data analytics can help in determining the ideal price of the product. it can also provide insights into the possibility of differentiated pricing of products based on the customers willingness to pay.big data can be used to leverage the next best alternative (nba) marketing approach. this is a customer-centric approach wherein unique, real-time promotional offers for a customer are considered and the optimal one is determined. this is radically different from the traditional approach of creating offers for the product first and then attempting to prospect.big data and analytics can also help in brand management by analyzing customer reviews/comments over a period of time. this is one of the best ways to identify customers expectation from the product. the reason for any sharp change in the level of overall satisfaction must be analyzed. tangentially, it can also be used to identify new potential markets and facilitate product diversification.forrester reveals that big data and analytics are being used by 44% of b2c marketers to improve responsiveness and that 36% actively use analytics and data mining for better forecasting. given how young the field of big data is, these are astounding figures.data, which were once qualitative (weight slim, fit, fat) have become quantitative (kgs, lbs) with the advancement in technology (the invention of the weighing machine). we are in a similar transitional phase in the way we market and sell goods. analytics provides ways of quantifying marketing decision, which can come in handy while recording, organizing, justifying and learning from our previous decisions. some of the ways in which we can augment our marketing decisions with analytics are listed below.research conducted by b2b leads concludes that a salesperson spends 50% of his time in unproductive prospecting. big data analytics can arrive at leads accurately by identifying people who actively search for a product. these leads can then be acted upon by the sales team.the sales force can also use analytics to improve on the logistics front. historical trends may be used as a predictor of demand and for stocking up the inventory. an earlier than expected delivery would greatly improve customer satisfaction and go a long way in customer retention.by delegating identification of potential customers to analytics, sales representatives have more time to spend on building a customer relationship, retaining customers, customer engagement and after-sales service.customers prefer personalized marketing communication. salesforce estimates that 65% of buyers from the b2b category would choose to switch brands if treated generically. analytics can help the sales team engage with the customers better, with personalized suggestions and offers.with wearable devices and iot gaining momentum, pharmaceuticals, fitness brands, sporting brands, and lifestyle stores can analyze their customers behavior and come up with suggestions. analysis of data from these devices would take personalization to a whole new level.analytics can be employed to identify how products reach customers. this helps the marketing team in zeroing down on the distribution channels that attract the customers more. this also helps them in identifying and mitigating the problem of counterfeit products in the market.cio insights report that 85% of organizations have trouble in accurately predicting sales as seen from the figure below. better sales forecasting using big data and analytics will lead to realistic target setting. this enables preparation of a better financial budget and gives the top management and the sales team a better overview of what to expect.fig 2. hurdles inaccurate sales forecastingsource: cio insightspredictive analytics has also brought about disruption in the job market. analytical skills and tools are becoming necessary to run a business and hence the marketing team must be equipped with knowledge of the same. in view of these changes, here are a few things that marketing leaders can do to build a big data and analytics centric marketing team:with ai and machine learning along with predictive analytics gaining momentum, marketing leaders must focus on change management to accommodate these technologies in their organization. though it seems overwhelming at first to delegate the organization-wide important decision to big data and analytics, leaders must also consider its long-term impact. trial runs before implementing organization-wide changes might help.with automation becoming a part of many jobs, most jobs would require redesigned roles. hence, the skill matrix of the organization needs to be updated.
marketing leaders must also build a culture of analytics-driven decision making in the organization. the best thing about data analytics is that it is helpful for organizations of all scales. for most smaller organizations, investment in predictive analytics holds the key for rapid expansion. large, established organizations also use analytics to understand trends in the market.
though several technologies have sprung up in the past before becoming irrelevant, predictive analytics doesnt seem like yet another one of those. judging by how essential it has become to all scales of business, predictive analytics is here to stay for a very long time! investing in them and building an organization centered around analytics would be a wise decision.

87,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/what-analytics-outsourcing-engagement-model-is-right-for-you/,What Analytics & IT Outsourcing engagement model is right for you? - Blackcoffer Insights,"analytics & it outsourcing should be a strategic partnership, not a simple hand-off of duties to a third-party. getting that right requires smart preparation.implemented correctly, strategic partnerships are a happy collaboration where expectations of delivery and results are clear from the start. by bringing in outside minds, its possible to innovate and drive your product to levels beyond what your internal team might have accomplished. new ideas can come from anywhere.a proper planning phase is important. its not only about thinking ahead but also about being on the same page with your analytics & it outsourcing provider every day and benefiting from their expertise, as opposed to viewing analytics & it outsourcing merely as an easy way to offload commodity work. you need to select the proper engagement model that is transparent to both parties and provides strong governance for all aspects of the relationship.to accomplish that, its useful to understand the various analytics & it outsourcing engagement models and how to best apply them to your situationin the case discussed here, software development.an engagement model is a framework that defines collaboration between a client and an analytics & it outsourcing vendor. it determines a level of control and responsibility, as well as provides a base for further relationship development. there is no best universal model to match every company`s needs.so how do you select an engagement model that works for your business? here is a brief overview of the most popular models grouped into tactical and strategic engagements.tactical engagement models:staff augmentationis the simplest model. this approach allows companies to extend existing in-house staff with outsourced workers. the typical clients business driver for such a model is cost reduction. it may work fine on a short-term basis, although it requires high client involvement to supervise the augmented staff. it means that project management and technical leadership remain on the clients side while routine development or testing, for example, can be augmented with offshore or nearshore resources provided by an analytics & it outsourcing vendor.there is no need to argue that the level of innovation from outsourced vendors with this model will be quite low in most cases. in fact, the less span of responsibility, the fewer drivers to innovate exist.with the staff augmentation model, the span of responsibility usually is quite narrow. it may include technical implementation tasks as well as prototyping, but the product vision and decision scope of the augmented team members are so limited that it doesnt facilitate thinking outside of the box.it is important to set proper expectations and establish alignment between a client and analytics & it outsourcing vendor on which party is responsible for steps in the product development life-cycle it helps avoid solving unpleasant issues in the future.project-basedis a time-bound engagement model effective for projects where requirements are not likely to change during the development process. it allows reducing cost and time to market by leveraging an outsourced vendor with the required technical and domain expertise. however, if requirements are frequently evolving or the planned engagement scope is more than one transactional project, it is better to consider strategic engagement models such as offshore/nearshore development center (odc/ndc) or product development services 2.0 (pds 2.0) [3].tactical consultancyis a generic term for a number of value-add services. the clients business driver here is the access to expertise not available in-house such as ux design, architecture, and technology advisory, security assessment and so on. it is usually provided by an analytics & it outsourcing vendor as a fixed price time-bound activity, although for the uncertain r&d type of work, the t&m basis can be considered as well.strategic engagement models:the next three models belong to the strategic group as they are based on long-term and more innovative relationships between a client and the analytics & it outsourcing vendor organization.
offshore/nearshore development centeris a flexible engagement model that greatly increases clients product development capacity. when product requirements are driven by a client, offshore/nearshore development center (odc/ndc) staff is managed by an analytics & it outsourcing vendor. this model can accommodate a high variety of projects and activities such as new product development, legacy modernization and maintenance, testing services and other long-term activities. however, clients who look for disruptive innovations and a larger span of vendor responsibility should consider the pds 2.0 model, which is next in our list.
product development services 2.0is the most innovative strategic engagement model that maximizes outputs from an analytics & it outsourcing relationship. the term pds 2.0 came from forrester`s comparison of traditional pds executed through project-based or odc models with a new innovative approach where the outsourced vendor holds a wide span of responsibility by designing and co-creating a product with a client. after the product release, the vendor, motivated by an outcome-based contract, continues product optimization and sustainability. this way, the entire product life-cycle can be outsourced to a strategic partner.
strategic consultancyis a value-driven consulting engagement aimed to improve process efficiency and the product quality of a clients organization. usually, it includes all aspects of the people/process/technology triangle with a high impact on a clients transformation and strategic decision making. the key takeaway is selecting a proper engagement model and ensuring that your tactical and strategic plans are shared with your partner will help you set up a solid foundation for further innovation. there is no need to stop at one or another levelcontinue evolving through engagement models over time to receive more value from long-lasting and fruitful partnerships.","['analytics', 'outsourcing', 'strategic', 'partnership', 'simple', 'hand', 'duty', 'third', 'party', 'getting',

88,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/big-data-analytics-solving-problems-banking-and-finance-industry/,How Big Data & Analytics is solving problems in the Banking and Finance Industry - Blackcoffer Insights,"modern companies want to know everything about their customers. they want to know where they are going, who they are meeting, what they are eating and of course what they are buying. they are one step ahead of the potential customer, knowing what shell do before she does herself. this, of course, only a distant dream just a few years back, is a reality today. the reason behind this is big data & analytics which is changing the way businesses function.in the banking and finance industry, its applications go much further than customer data, and the potential for its uses are immense to the say the least.here are a few significant areas where firms can (and are) benefitting from big data analytics.customer segmentation and personalized marketingalthough we might consider ourselves to be unique, statistically speaking we can always be clubbed under a fixed set of personality profiles or customer segments. these profiles can, almost with precision, predict most of our online activity patterns and purchase behavior. this particular application of big data is one which spans sectors. in banking, this helps the banks deliver the right offer or product to the right customer segment.taking customer segmentation a step further, personalized marketing is what garners the most hits. depending on whether the consumer is looking to buy a house or some clothes, he is offered a house loan or a credit card. customized offerings are made to individual customers after analyzing their recent purchase activity and online behavior.cross-selling, or the act of selling an existing customer an additional product, is another practice that has become easier to convert into a sale due to customization using personalized data.risk management and fraudby nature, the banking industry is a sector where the firm not only wants to but should know about its clients. user card limits, loan sanctions, and credit scores are all metrics requiring deep insight into the behavior of the consumer. and big data has been a panacea to the hurdles in these activities. high-risk customers come with the likelihood of default but are also the drivers of revenue. with analytical modeling, a risk assessment predictor forecasts the default risk probability which helps the banks take a suitable decision. the risk-reward tradeoff is optimized which in turn maximizes profitability.these models are also used by banks to frame their credit policies and strategies. credit exposure is managed right from its origination to fulfillment. default percentages are now internalized in the policies, and the banks have effective provisions in place for them.fraud analytics is perhaps the most sought-after predictive analytics related information in the banking sector. as per a 2017 release by pti, banks in india lost an estimated 17,000 to frauds in that year. through profiling and historical statistics, fraud can not only be detected very early, but it can also be prevented altogether.operations optimization strategiesnumerous process that banks undertake can easily be automated owing to big data, which would save many man hours and otherwise spent resources. some examples are loan sanctions, queue optimizations, and process efficiency strategies. an example will highlight one of the various operations optimizations that are possible through big data. suppose a bank incentivizes the data updating process of customers that is carried out by employees in terms of the number of such cases an employee can update in a day. after a while, the employees might start taking up the easier or the less time-consuming cases so as to maximize the number of updation cases they can take up. this would mean a few cases might not get taken up at all. this would be an undesirable situation. with big data analytics, it would be possible to analyze and assign weights to the cases that get left out to modify the incentivization process. this rather simplistic example is representative of the numerous ways processes in a firm can be optimized.regulationit is a well-known fact that banks and financial institutions have to meet a lot of mandatory regulatory requirements. analytics models are used to predict and hence internalize a lot of requirements that the banks may have to comply with beforehand. this ranges from a lot of things such as prediction of stress days (i.e. days on which higher than usual withdrawals happen) to meet the minimum liquidity requirements, to macro level predictions to make provisions for taxations or exposure.since the 2008 financial crisis, the number of such compliance norms has grown even further and a lot of them have been enforced very recently. this means the banks have yet to make much headway on a standardized efficient way of tackling them. big data & analytics holds the key to successful compliance in this regard.feedbackcustomer relations can be considered as the foremost driver of business growth in a lot of aspects. based on the customer segmentation strategies and the feedback received from the individuals, big data can help predict the best possible tactic for grievance redressal which in turn can maximize customer satisfaction.organizational development and employee relationsemployee engagement is an area that arguably has the maximum scope for big data applications. it can be used in salary and incentive optimization to maximize performance, identifying employees at attrition risk (both current and at entry level) to reduce turnover and to incorporate their feedback to increase the satisfaction and hence productivity.thus in a data-powered world, enhancing capabilities in big data & analytics can drive sustainable growth, reduce risk and maximize performance. though its implementation is yet to be materialized on a large scale, judging by its potential for value addition, it would not be long before it becomes commonplace. big data & analytics is the driver of a revolution and theres no turning back.","['modern', 'company', 'want', 'know', 'everything', 'customer', 'want', 'know', 'going', 'meeting', 'eating', 'course', 'buying', 'one', 'step', 'ahead',

storage: with the latest developments in technology, the amount of data being generated and captured is increasing at an alarming rate. even though most enterprises currently prefer on-premise data storage which has the advantage of having better control over security and access, it has become difficult to modify, scale and adapt to situations. future: many organizations are slowly shifting to cloud storage and various hybrid approaches to store their data. this provides a highly scalable, cost-effective solution which provides ease of access. security: with the recent episodes of high profile hackings, security breaches, ransomware, etc security has become a huge concern in this technological era. from a small action like leaving the laptop unsecured to highly sophisticated hacking, data is not safe in spite of many initiatives being taken. future: employees are being educated in transmission security, authentication protocols, and controls over access, integrity, and auditing. procedures such as using the latest anti-virus software, setting up firewalls, encrypting sensitive data, and using multi-factor authentication are some of the ways to prevent security attacks.
as we move forward in 2018, organizations will have to analyze much more complex and high-volume data. with the development of customized, highly efficient data analytics practices, organizations can make sense of the data and use it for providing efficient personalized care. data integrity is bound to become the most important factor as the effectiveness of data analysis methods are dependent on the incorporation of error-free, relevant data from quality sources.

91,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/big-data-marketing-reality/,From Utopia to Reality: Marketing and the Big Data Revolution - Blackcoffer Insights,"perfect information. first degree price discrimination. you might know these terms from high school economics defining utopian conditions in the marketplace. one involves having instantaneous knowledge of all market prices, utilities, and cost functions. the other involves selling each customer a good as per his individual willingness to pay. well, these so-called utopian conditions are just a few among the many impossibilities that have been made realities due to big data & analytics. big data and analytics is the perfect couple; statisticians often refer to sample size (the number of people used to estimate a model) and believe that as the sample size tends to a larger number, it eventually gives a better estimate. this is what big data does, increasing the sample size to make a precise model which applies to every case. marketing and sales are one of those areas where it is revolutionizing the existing structures to make a more consumer-pleasing platform.the domain of marketing has 4 ps (price, product, place, promotion) and the infusion of big data in each of these has enhanced its dynamics in ways which couldnt have been imagined ten years ago.sellers now have personalized information about buyers and using this information they can infer the maximum price a buyer is ready to give for it leading to somewhat first-degree price discrimination. big data has changed the domain of pricing decisions.did you know that a unit percent increase in the price of a product could boost profits by an approximate of 8.7 percent(without losing volume)?now, how much a consumer is willing to pay can be estimated using a model generated by usage of big data. this is called price optimisation.imagine getting a predicted-hurricane alert one week before, as a general store manager what products would you stock up your shop with?all the emergency goods like flashlights, batteries, toiletries, radios, first aid kits and strawberry poptarts?yes, it is precisely what walmart did. it stocked up on the strawberry poptarts. using the petabytes of data it generates every hour it made a predictive analysis with the previous data to discern that the sales of poptarts increased multifold with hurricane forecast. stores find out patterns using their database to create sales predictions.product placementit is optimized using analytics, figuring out what products will people buy with a specific type of good and then keeping them together increases the units per transaction (upt).ever wondered why when you went on a trip to a humid place, there was a product advertisement of an anti-frizzy hair shampoo? the weather channels doesnt just predict the weather; it predicts the kind of sales that would increase or decrease due to weather and season change, thereby able to promote according to your location. this is the enabling of big data analysis in the domain of place and allocation.a father of a teenage girl found baby vouchers and crib discounts mailed to her name by target, a departmental store in the united states of america. unsuspectingly, he accused target of putting wrong ideas in his daughters head, while in actuality; the girl had an upcoming baby. the store had made predictions about the pregnancy using a model which would track the kind of purchases a pregnant customer had made in the past by accumulating data and shaping a predictor, thus giving them a head start to promote their store and baby-related products.promotion of a productrequires timing and the skill of executing it in the right manner. it takes place in two stages; pre-production and the release of the product. the pre-production commercialization would focus on the branding of prospects of an upcoming product that satisfies customer needs like never before. then, during commercialization, they focus on the geo-necessity and demand of the products. using real-time analysis, firms personalize their target allocations.big data enlarges our opportunities to understand the consumer brain better. one of the ways how customer reaction is gauged the quickest is using the sentiment analysis which combined statistical modeling with linguistic rules to judge the positive or negative feedback (or sentiment) to the kind of product or advertisement they look at and respond to. sentiment analysis would help you identify your customer base, your negatives, and scopes of improvement.in todays time, its difficult for the market to create a loyal customer. there are innumerable options, and each seems better than the previous one. customer retention can be brought about by building a relationship with them, in which they begin trusting the seller. costco, after analyzing the data of other fruit stores and shops predicted a possible contamination of a few fruits, after which they personally called and messaged their customers to send out warnings about their purchases which included those fruits that they sold hence, conveying out a message that indicated we care.by catering to the needs of customers using their opinions from social media websites, reviews, ratings, and personalization give insights into new product developments and improving the existing ones adapting to the customer pain points and resolving them to an extent. the acumens are made by taking into account what the consumer likes and dislikes about a product. models are devised that determine the demand curve of a product, they predict the sales of the product and assess the brand strength, awareness, and preference of a company.online fashion stores are working towards automated personalized clothing without any human intervention so that they can offer better choices to each buyer, amongst the millions of clothes in their online wardrobe. in the near future, big data may be able to make insightful applications and technology customized to your needs because it will learn from and about you beforehand. it has come a long way and it has a long way to go changing everything imaginable into a reality.","['perfect', 'information', 'first', 'degree', 'price', 'discrimination', 'might', 'know', 'term', 'high', 'school', 'economics', 'defining', 'utopian', 'condition', 'marketplace', 'one',

thus saving both time and money for the doctor and patient. in the future, this may further allow point-of-care decision-making that will enable doctors to make quick, life-saving calls at point-of-care through the use of tools with inbuilt data processing capability.big data applications in the field of data analytics which can disrupt the healthcare sector in developing nations can be emulated from the below classic milestones:ibm predicts a 20% abatement inpatient mortality rate as the medicinal field gears to dissect streaming patient data with large-scale software applications. indeed, even now, significant organizations like microsoft, dell, ibm, and oracle are spearheading information mining stages that will enable medicinal experts to stay atop patient information and offer enhanced medical care.google flu trends: a service that predicts and locates outbreaks of the flu by making use of information aggregate search queries.the san francisco-based global viral forecasting initiative (gvfi) utilizes propelled information investigation on data, mined from the internet to recognize thoroughly the areas, sources, and drivers of local outbreaks before they wind up as global epidemics.ibm, through the launch of smarter cities initiatives, has support home care of chronically ill patients (e.g. stavanger hospital in norway)accenture focuses on the 4% chronically sick patients that tie up over 60% of the healing center assets through an administration that screens the constantly sick patients who can live at home, avoiding readmission to doctors facility.
a large number of these conceivable outcomes are as of now being actualized, however, a few potential outcomes are somewhat more remote off. in any case, it seems promising to consider that the collection of tremendous amounts of information can and will profoundly affect lives spared and enhanced by medical technology.

where their chances of winning are the most. it has been used prominently in various elections all around the world recently. it actually makes sense to micro-target the voters on the basis of how likely they are going to vote for a specific leader or how is the image and perception of a leader in the minds of the voters.next big thingthe next big use of big data analytics could be for the potential voters who could actually get to know their leaders in a better and quantifiable way which would ultimately help them in choosing the right leader. most of the electors vote for the political leaders on the basis of their image and recent perception. the claims which the leaders make in their election manifestoes are not much used by the general public and is never quantified as to whether the tall claims which these leaders had made in the past were completed timely or not. the track record of the leaders is not judged and analyzed by the general public as it is a humongous task for an individual. big data analytics could actually help the electors and the general public in knowing their potential leaders closely.the claims which these leaders have made in the past decade either through manifestoes or through election rallies could be listed, with the score being assigned to every task on the basis of effective and timely completion. these tasks would vary hugely so weights could be assigned to them depending on its implementation and its impact on the lives of people directly or indirectly.these days the lives of the political leaders are closely being followed on the internet with the help of news channels, magazines, blogs, and social media as well. all this data could be captured and relevant information could be clubbed together to create meaningful insights. the leaders interact with people on social media and there conduct and behavior could be easily captured. such a tool could be very actively used in comparing the competing leaders in a specific region.usageall this information could be of great use to the public because in the fast-paced world it is very difficult for working class people to interact with the leaders by attending the election rallies. big data analytics could be effectively used by the leaders in communicating their points to the general public and in return, it could also be used as a tool by the general public in knowing their political leaders. this tool could also be used for the self-improvement purpose of the politicians wherein they could analyze their own behavior and also feedback can be captured for specific points of the behavior.the overall budget of the elections has been increasing significantly over the past decades. roughly rs. 30,000 crore were spent in the lok sabha elections in 2014 and this amount would increase manifold in the coming elections. big data analytics could actually help in reducing the overall expenditure incurred by the political parties as the battleground is expected to shift to the social media in the coming elections and all the analysis could prove to be worthy enough as an excellent tool. also, it is very important to understand that choosing the right leader could impact the lives of the people for the next 5 years.sponsorshipbig data analytics could be used by rating agencies which could actually launch ratings for politicians and this could be used by the general public in determining how good the leader is. once the ecosystem is in setup it could be sponsored by the leader itself wherein the party or the leader would want to rate the previous results and personality which if quantified could substantiate their claims in the current scenario. obviously, the second model would have to be properly audited else it would lose out the credibility. even the government led organizations could actually keep a track of the election manifestoes of the leaders and then keep a real-time track of the progress of the key developments relating to the subjects in the set agenda.","['introductionevery', 'day', 'world', 'creating', 'roughly', 'quintillion', 'byte', 'data', 'application', 'big', 'data', 'could', 'lasting',

the quality and the efficiency of the system dramatically increase by employing iot in various phases and the results have been illustrated as below: effects of using iot in oil & gas industry
cyber-security:
another important area that benefits are the cybersecurity of the oil & gas industry. this has been in the area that has been a vulnerable posing threat to the nation. the cyber attack can lead to seepage of sensitive information which can prove costly and even lead to a plant shutdown. with the increase in the involvement of digital technology, the risk of cyberterrorism has also evolved which might end up in industrial espionage and disruption of operations. due to this increased risk, as per the reports by abi research, the oil and gas companies are planning to spend $1.87 billion on protection against cyber attack in 2018. but, the best part is that this rise in risk due to data-based linkages of operations is dealt with the help of digital technology only. the data and the information of rigs, refineries, and headquarters can be encrypted from end to end and safety can be ensured. thus, there is a need for an approach which can deal with the issue of cyber-security in the oil and gas sector in programmatically and sustainably.

97,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/data-analytics-reduce-cost-production/,Data Analytics as a Tool to Reduce the Cost of Production in Oil & Gas - Blackcoffer Insights,"data analytics as a tool to reduce the cost of production in oil & gasoil & gas sector is one of the core industries of india and they play important role in influencing the decision making other sections of the economy. the government has taken many steps keeping in mind the increasing demand of the oil and gas, the government has allowed 100 percent foreign direct investment in many sectors including natural gas, petroleum and many more, because of which it has attracted foreign and domestic investors like reliance industries ltd and cairn india.companies in oil and gas business also aim to achieve the similar goals that other industries are doing that is producing the product at low cost and selling it for the higher cost and making good profits, but for oil and gas companies owner its quite challenging, because finding and producing gas and petroleum are expensive. as oil and gas industry is working hard to meet the global demand of energy, there are many other challenges that industry faces a major external challenge that they face is the environment in which the upstream industry operates. like always with challenges come opportunity, the opportunity for the upstream industry to reshape operations in which they work from reservoir to refinery, using big data and analytics, many companies are using these techniques as they help them to optimize their operations by reducing the cost and increasing the productivity thereby helping in making profits. a recent study by kimberly firm, they found out that offshore oil and gas industries lose $49 million annually due to unplanned downtime and for some companies its up to $88 million, by using big data and analytics companies can save up to 20% in their capital expenditure and can cut upstream cost by 3-5%. a study by bain & company indicates that harnessing big data with analytics in the oil and gas industry could help them improve production by 6% to 8%. better data analytics can improve the ability to find the product, reduce the cost of development and production, and make energy more affordable and safer to extract.the operator can incorporate big data solutions using retrofits equipment sensor, it can have a very fast payoff in terms of reducing maintenance cost and increasing reliability. connecting the cloud, usingasset performance management (apm) software powered by ges predix is a suite of software that connects upstream assets to the digital world, using this software companies can get informative data from their sensors, which will help them improve their operations, which will effectively help in reducing the cost of production. iot and predictive big data analysis can be used in the oil and gas sector for maintaining and making proper models that are easy to be optimized, software like las log analytics can are used with hdp big data analytics for oil and gas allows scientists to ingest and query their disparate las data for use in predictive models. they can do this while leveraging existing statistical tools such as sas or r to build new models and then rapidly iterate them with billions of measurements. combining las data with production, lease, and treatment data can increase production and margins.the statistical tool like sas can be very efficient in oil and gas industry; its used from planning to production in every stage, from countering the risk of cost inherent in oilfield exploration to improving reserve exploration strategies. it can help in finding the uncover hidden patterns in the data by revealing the connection not evident before linking all the data to each other. sas can help in seeing the full picture by adopting a data integration platform that aggregates data from exploration, drilling, completion, reservoir, production and more, helping in taking the right decision and optimizing the production and reducing the cost.there are so many technologies available which help in saving time and cost on of which is real-time data, real-time data focus on how to drive better insight from data quicker than ever in real time.real-time data at well site help in reducing the decision latency curve (source: mobilize).leading oil & gas companies have already begun projects in which they are using big data technologies. which is helping them to track new business opportunities, reduce costs and increase in production.by recognizing the value of the unexploited data assets in supporting fact-based decision making, oil & gas companies establish real cases of big data uses. so that they can enhance their business value based on innovation and able to lead towards a sustainable competition.over the coming years, the industry will be defined by those who will take advantage of digital and analytics to evolve. investing in these will help digital to deliver better efficiency and productivity, for the brighter future of the industry.blackcoffer analytica, ravi kumar","['data', 'analytics', 'tool', 'reduce', 'cost', 'production', 'oil',

to enable more timely and effective operations decisions, the retailer should create a seamless reporting framework that provides granular, real-time information from the sales floor to its suppliers inventory and production schedules, which allows targeting of new customers and better inventory forecasting. in addition, transactional information from the retailers core platforms should be standardized and integrated into a single reporting framework to improve visibility into business activity, enabling deeper insight into customer needs.
with these new capabilities, managers can quickly respond to marketplace demands and address business challenges. having real-time and granular visibility into store-level sell-through and inventory data enables optimized replenishment and merchandising practices, while supply chain transparency promotes lower-cost logistics. the solution can be positioned the company for competitive advantage by helping boost sales and lower operational costs.","['big', 'data', 'emerged', 'one', 'biggest', 'business', 'technological', 'buzzword', 'recent', 'year', 'term', 'big', 'data', 'applies', 'information', 'processed', 'analyzed', 'using', 'traditional', 'tool', 'process', 'number', 'company', 'leading', 'development', 'big', 'data', 'analytics', 'program', 'creating', 'unique', 'package', 'retailer', 'suggests', 'going', 'big', 'impact', 'retail', 'industry', 'using', 'big', 'data', 'identify', 'promotion', 'item', 'actually', 'grow', 'category', 'sale', 'store', 'profit', 'top', 'opportunity', 'identified', 'retail', 'professional', 'innovation', 'big', 'data', 'retail', 'often', 'bog', 'vastness', 'potential', 'leaving', 'retailer', 'vaguest', 'guidance', 'try', 'figure', 'invest', 'powerful', 'tool', 'early', 'big', 'data', 'effort', 'targeted', 'sourcing', 'analyzing', 'internal', 'data', 'also', 'true', 'retailer', 'retail', 'industry', 'internal', 'data', 'primary', 'source', 'big', 'data', 'retail', 'organization', 'retailer', 'take', 'pragmatic', 'approach', 'adopt', 'big', 'data', 'also', 'tremendous', 'untapped', 'value', 'still', 'locked', 'away', 'internal', 'system', 'value', 'making', 'big', 'data', 'source', 'retailer', 'transactionslog', 'dataeventse', 'mailssocial', 'mediasensorsexternal', 'feedsrfid', 'scan', 'po', 'datafree', 'textgeospatialaudiostill', 'image', 'videoit', 'advised', 'retailer', 'active', 'big', 'data', 'effort', 'analyze', 'transaction', 'data', 'well', 'log', 'data', 'transaction', 'log', 'data', 'machine', 'generated', 'data', 'produced', 'record', 'detail', 'every', 'operational', 'transaction', 'automated', 'function', 'performed', 'within', 'retailer', 'business', 'information', 'system', 'data', 'outgrown', 'ability', 'stored', 'analyzed', 'many', 'traditional', 'system', 'result', 'many', 'case', 'data', 'collected', 'year', 'analyzed', 'retailer', 'also', 'make', 'use', 'rfid', 'scan', 'point', 'sale', 'po', 'data', 'natural', 'area', 'retailer', 'lead', 'given', 'history', 'dependence', 'po', 'data', 'transaction', 'unlike', 'industry', 'retailer', 'severely', 'lagged', 'analyzing', 'free', 'form', 'text', 'data', 'retailer', 'reporting', 'use', 'compared', 'industry', 'may', 'represent', 'opportunity', 'retailer', 'become', 'early', 'adopter', 'area', 'analysis', 'early', 'adopter', 'big', 'data', 'turning', 'information', 'insight', 'deliver', 'value', 'organization', 'example', 'global', 'footwear', 'retailer', 'leverage', 'transactional', 'insight', 'generate', 'new', 'opportunity', 'business', 'growth', 'previously', 'company', 'order', 'sale', 'inventory', 'financial', 'data', 'dispersed', 'across', 'company', 'making', 'difficult', 'manager', 'quickly', 'access', 'data', 'needed', 'make', 'critical', 'business', 'decision', 'manager', 'couldnt', 'identify', 'product', 'greatest', 'demand', 'resulting', 'warehouse', 'overstocked', 'le', 'popular', 'item', 'hot', 'item', 'back', 'order', 'enable', 'timely', 'effective', 'operation', 'decision', 'retailer', 'create', 'seamless', 'reporting', 'framework', 'provides', 'granular', 'real', 'time', 'information', 'sale', 'floor', 'supplier', 'inventory', 'production', 'schedule', 'allows', 'targeting', 'new', 'customer', 'better', 'inventory', 'forecasting', 'addition', 'transactional', 'information', 'retailer', 'core', 'platform', 'standardized', 'integrated', 'single', 'reporting', 'framework', 'improve', 'visibility', 'business', 'activity', 'enabling', 'deeper', 'insight', 'customer', 'need', 'new', 'capability', 'manager', 'quickly', 'respond', 'marketplace', 'demand', 'address', 'business', 'challenge', 'real', 'time', 'granular', 'visibility', 'store', 'level', 'sell', 'inventory', 'data', 'enables', 'optimized', 'replenishment', 'merchandising', 'practice', 'supply', 'chain', 'transparency', 'promotes', 'lower', 'cost', 'logistics', 'solution', 'positioned', 'company', 'competitive', 'advantage', 'helping', 'boost', 'sale', 'lower', 'operational', 'cost']",368,27,7,0.5882,0.0924,14.72,171,46.46739130434783,24.47495652173913,22.48,[],5.815602836879433,2.3940217391304346
99,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/role-big-data-cyber-security/,Role of Big Data in Cyber Security - Blackcoffer Insights,"the ongoing digitalization of the business world is putting companies at risk of cyber-attacks more than ever before. big data analysis has the potential to offer protection against these attacks.cyber security threats are risingsince the notion of a corporate security perimeter has all but disappeared in recent years thanks to the growing adoption of cloud and mobile services, information security has experienced a profound paradigm shift from traditional perimeter protection tools towards monitoring and detecting malicious activities within corporate networks.increasingly sophisticated attack methods used by cybercriminals and the growing role of malicious insiders in several recent large scale security breaches clearly indicate that traditional approaches to information security can no longer keep up.companies have to rethink their cyber security conceptsanalytics is the key element in leveraging cyber resilience. with increasingly advanced and persistent attacks and the simple fact that every organization must protect itself against all varieties of attacks while an attacker only needs one successful attempt, organizations must rethink their cybersecurity concepts. they have to move beyond pure prevention towards the pdr paradigm: prevent detect respond.how big data analytics fits in?at the core of this approach stands improved detection and that is where big data analytics comes into play. detection must be able to identify changing use patterns; to execute complex analysis rapidly, close to real-time; to perform complex correlations across a variety of data sources ranging from server and application logs to network events and user activities.this requires both advanced analytics beyond simple rule-based approaches and the ability to run analysis on large amounts of current and historical data big data security analytics. combining the current state of analytics with security helps organizations improve their cyber resilience.big data security analytics: a new generation of security toolsas the security industrys response to these challenges, a new generation of security analytics solutions has emerged in recent years, which are able to collect, store and analyze huge amounts of security data across the whole enterprise in real-time.enhanced by additional context data and external threat intelligence, this data is then analyzed using various correlation algorithms to detect anomalies and thus identify possible malicious activities.unlike traditional siem solutions, such tools operate in near real-time and generate a small number of security alerts ranked by severity according to a risk model. these alerts are enriched with additional forensic details and are able to greatly simplify a security analysts job and enable quick detection and mitigation of cyber-attacks.what made big data security analytics possible?the biggest technological breakthrough that made these solutions possible is big data analytics.the industry has finally reached the point where business intelligence algorithms for large-scale data processing, previously affordable only to large corporations, have become commoditized. utilizing readily available frameworks such as apache hadoop and inexpensive hardware, vendors are now able to build big data solutions for collecting, storing, and analyzing huge amounts of unstructured data in real-time.combining data to predict suspicious activitythis makes it possible to combine real-time and historical analysis and identify new incidents that could be related to others that occurred in the past.coupled with external security intelligence sources that provide current information about the latest vulnerabilities, this can greatly facilitate the identification of ongoing advanced cyber-attacks on the network.having a large amount of historical data at hand also significantly simplifies initial calibration to the normal patterns of activity of a given network, which are then used to identify anomalies. existing solutions are already capable of automated calibration with very little input required from administrators.identifying relevant incidentsbased on proven big data analytics algorithms, these solutions can identify outliers and other anomalies insecurity data, which almost always indicate some kind of malicious or at least suspicious activity.by filtering out the statistical noise, big data security analytics can reduce massive flows of raw security events to a manageable number of concise and clearly categorized alerts to allow even an inexperienced person to make a decision on them. still, by keeping all historical information available for later analysis, it provides a forensic expert with much more detail about the incident and its relationship to other historical anomalies.automating workflowsfinally, modern big data security analytics solutions provide multiple automated workflows for responding to detected threats, such as disrupting clearly identified malware attacks or submitting a suspicious event to a managed security service for further analysis. automated controls for cybersecurity and fraud detection have been identified as one of the key business drivers for future adoption.

systematic data inaccuracies have no quick fixes. the most helpful, long-term solution would be for payers, especially medicare, to relax documentation requirements so that providers can focus data entry on clinical, not billing, needs.technical solutions to healthcare data quality issuealternatively, there are promising technical solutions such as machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence that trains systems to make predictions about certain characteristics of data. while machine learning has proved successful for identifying missing diagnoses,it is of limited use for critical clinical data like symptoms and physical exam findings. in addition, the richest source of clinical data, the clinicians notes, remains largely beyond the reach of big data. there have been substantial improvements in natural language processing (nlp) to identify key information from clinical notes.however, until the quality of those notes improves, it will be hard for nlp programs to glean important information. continued investment in technical solutions will undoubtedly improve data accuracy, but without fundamental changes to how care is documented, healthcare should be circumspect about healthcare ability to rid data of systematic errors.
data fragmentation in healthcare
even if healthcare achieves perfect data accuracy, a second daunting challenge remains data fragmentation. incomplete data are common in clinical practice and reflect healthcare space highly fragmented healthcare system where patients see multiple clinicians whose electronic health record do not communicate. despite significant policy interest, healthcare has yet to achieve any meaningful level of interoperability and without it, creating a comprehensive picture of patients care will be nearly impossible. incomplete data, like inaccurate data, can also lead to missed or spurious associations that can be wasteful or even harmful to patient care.
the solutions to addressing fragmented data are no easier than those to address inaccurate data. achieving greater interoperability between electronic clinical systems has been pursued by policymakers for nearly 2 decades with little success.while policymakers have recently renewed their efforts, their primary focus, moving specific pieces of clinical information (such as a laboratory test result) between individual healthcare providers, will do little to ensure that provider organization has a comprehensive picture of the patients care across all care sites. many patients and privacy advocates are understandably concerned about efforts to aggregate data. however, with adequate de-identification and security safeguards, the risks of aggregation can be minimized and the benefits of better care at lower costs are substantial.
conclusion
the potential for big data in healthcare is enormous and exciting. it is hard to find a delivery system that is not thinking about how to leverage electronic health record data, and researchers are eager to answer new types of questions. realizing the most from healthcares large national investment in health it demands that healthcare space learns from the newly available data. doing so requires that healthcare understand the issues of data quality and address them effectively. the solutions are not easy. however, ignoring these challenges could quickly lead healthcare from the hope of big data to the disappointing and wasteful results of bad data.

this data could be:periodic revenue (vs prior period)costs (vs prior period)headcount (by department)sales pipeline3. analytical dashboardsan analytical dashboard could display operational or strategic data. however, this type of dashboard will offer drill-down functionality allowing the user to explore more of the data and get different insights. often dashboards include this functionality when it is not required. do not simply provide this functionality because you can.bear in mind that different user groups may require a different type of dashboard. the marketing manager may need both a strategic and operational view of their data. where possible create two separate dashboards.group data logically use space wiselya well-designed dashboard will ensure that data is displayed in logical groups. for example, if a dashboard includes financial kpis and sales pipeline, ensure that the financial data is displayed next to each other, with the sales pipeline data displayed together in a separate logical group. grouping is often by department or functional area and can include:product (inventory, development)sales/marketingfinance (actuals and forecasts)peopleoften the most important real-estate on a dashboard (top left-hand corner) is reserved for a company logo or a navigation tool. this is not good dashboard practice as the part of the screen is the most important part of your dashboard (this is because most western languages read from top to bottom and from left to right hence our eye will start its journey when discovering something new at the top left-hand corner.make the data relevant to the audiencean executive dashboard can have a number of different audiences. ensure that the data you display is relevant to the users. think about the scope and reach of your data:the whole companyby departmentindividualssuppliersensure that you understand exactly who the intended audience is and the scope of their requirements. in a small organization, the executive dashboard is likely to include kpi data across all departments. however, in a larger company, each department may have their own executive dashboard.gaining agreement on dashboard components from non-related parties are doomed to fail.dont clutter your dashboard present the most important metrics only
dashboards are often cluttered. cluttered displays deflect the focus from the important messages. some are cluttered with useful and relevant information and some are cluttered with useless and irrelevant information. neither of these situations is desirable.
each dashboard-type may require different amounts of data (for example an executive dashboard may only need 6 numbers, whereas an operational dashboard may need upwards of 20) there is no hard and fast rule to follow here, except ensuring that everything you display is relevant and meaningful to the audience. do not add a graph or text simply because you can. how often does the data really need to be refreshed?
ensuring that your dashboard data is being refreshed at the right intervals saves time during development (why go through the pain of sourcing real-time data, when all you need is a weekly feed) and can ensure optimal performance once the dashboard is live.
examples of refresh rates on dashboards include: real-time (or near real-time)
daily, weekly, monthly as a rule of thumb, operational dashboards require data in real-time or near real-time, whereas executive/strategic dashboards require data refreshed on a less frequent basis.","['introductiondashboards', 'often', 'created', 'fly', 'data', 'added', 'simply', 'white', 'space', 'used', 'different', 'people', 'company', 'ask', 'different', 'data', 'displayed', 'soon',

102,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/role-big-data-academia/,Role of Big Data in Academia - Blackcoffer Insights,"can academia, researchers, decision makers and policy makers manage the challenges of broader collaboration and privacy to harness value from big data?for academia, researchers and decision-makers, and for many other sectors like retail, healthcare, insurance, finance, capital markets, real estate, pharmaceutical, oil & gas, big data looks like a new eldorado: a fantastic mine of information where we hope to find the key to great discoveries. in the social sciences, humanities, etc., for example, questions such as what is social media data telling us about our societies, humanities, consumers, people live nearby? or how can big data be used to efficiently allocate resources, such as energy or capital or technology or manpower? are becoming more frequent.quite naturally, academia is abuzz, thinking of how to best use big data, big data technologies & platforms. it is also teeming with competitiveness, as researchers race to make the discoveries waiting for us in those massive data centers.a cautious approachthat being said, academics, researchers and especially universities, must exercise caution. there are some unique risks that must be taken into account, risks that stem from academic research being (in most cases) made publicly available. therefore, all the results obtained, the methods used, and often all the data collected during a research project will eventually be made publicly available. this level of transparency is unique to academia. so however magical big data may appear, using it requires careful considerations of both data protection laws and of research ethical principles.concretely, when using data that was produced by individuals, we must not only take care to respect their privacy when processing the data, we must also ensure that the content produced cannot be used against them. further precautions must be taken when working with data from vulnerable individuals, such as young children and teenagers, for instance.in that respect, the considerable experience that universities have to handle human subject data within the life sciences is of great help and existing research protocols devised in that context are being adapted to address the new challenges posed by big data.from big data to big collaborationresearchers in statistics and mathematics have to be mindful of and interact closely with, concepts of law and ethics. this is one of many examples of collaborations and interactions across academic fields driven by the use and exploration of big data. the reason for this is that becausebig data requires a widerbig data requires a wider range of expertise to be applied simultaneously to answer research questionsrange of expertise to be applied simultaneously to answer research questions. in contrast, to understand smaller, traditional data sets used not so long ago, knowing both the data and the methods would be sufficient to tackle most projects.consider an effort to understand the drivers behind memes on twitter. a meme is an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. a typical research project could, for example, try to understand how memes develop, who they spread to and why? such a project would require a software engineer able to produce the database necessary to manage the large data set; a statistician or machine-learner to develop the proper methodology to explore the data and learn its properties; a linguist to help efficiently mine the tweets by identifying the relevant semantic structures; a social scientist to interpret the results and frame the research questions, and so on.one of the challenges for academia is that there is no culture of collaboration on this scale in the field yet. finding the right skills and synergies to produce efficient teamwork is the first challenge academics face when tackling a big data project.the changing nature of databut it is not the size of big data that requires so many different skills. in that sense, the term big data is misleading. what makes big data different is the way the data is collected.traditionally data was collected for a specific purpose, relating to a specific scientific question. academics sought to first delineate a scientific question, then build the most appropriate techniques to answer that question, and finally collect the appropriate data set to use the technique on. this systematic process led, hopefully, to an answer.this tradition dates back to greek antiquity when, for instance,eratosthenesmeasured the angle of the sun at different locations, and used geometry to compute the circumference of the globe.in this setting, we have a clear research question: what is the circumference of the globe? to address this question, eratosthenes used geometry to identify where he will find this answer: the angle of the sun at different locations. then, he found how to accurately measure that information: using agnomon.the research project presented three clear steps that could be addressed independently. this paradigm is now shifting. the problem big data poses for academics and data scientist, in general, is that extracting value and insight from the data requires doing two processes simultaneously: discovering the informational content and how to extract it. the where and the how must be done at the same time.this is why the comparison with an eldorado and a gold rush is appropriate: we know there is valuable information to be extracted from big data, but we do not know where exactly to find it in the data set and or how to extract it.consider the twitter memes we introduced above. the research question of interest in this example is the evolution of memes and their drivers. to address this question, we must define where this information can be found and how to extract it.the answer to both questions is the intuition that the data set (tweets published online) contains a massive amount of information about memes: which ones are currently trending, how they form and spread, etc. however, it is unclear where the information can be found in this corpus (should one automatically detect a meme? should a data-expert list the memes?). there is also no methodology on how to extract this information once located (what measures should we use to describe memes evolutions? how do these measures relate? what measures are computationally feasible?). finally, all these questions must be answered simultaneously to coherently address the problem.the most successful solution to date is to frame very focused research questions and aim to capture only the information you are interested in, and nothing else. defining the scope of the project too broadly runs the risk of corrupting the extracted information or limits the ability to extract the information in a scalable way. in effect, to reduce the confusion caused by addressing both the how and the why at the same time, research questions must be very precise and well defined.using big data to understand networksthe need for a focused approach can be made more concrete when considering network analysis. a network is made up of individual entities and the relationships between them. these can range from human social networks, neural network, electric networks, or protein interaction networks, for example.we would expect that methods for analyzing one type of network would apply to others. this is true in principle, however, the research problem of interest for each network is different. for instance, when considering a social network, we are often interested in how communities form and interact. when considering protein interaction networks, we are interested in the role a particular protein plays in the overall network.in terms of methodology, addressing simultaneously the global scale community problem (in social networks) and the local scale role problem (in protein networks) remains an open question. but, by addressing each problem separately, efficient methods can be devised. therefore, the research question must focus on one of the two aspects: either local or global.the incompatibility of the two approaches is due to the very different mathematical tools used to address both problems. for community detection, the network is regarded as a large matrix, and tools usually rely on theeigenvectorsofthat matrix.on the other hand, to determine the role of each node, the network is considered as a graph and the occurrence of small shapes around a given node are enumerated. the former being algebraic in nature, and the later combinatorial in nature, it is not straightforward to articulate the two approaches in a single method.one set of tools is needed to identify what community a given agent belongs to, and another to describe the role of a given agent. however, there isnt a tool that does both. as a consequence, it is necessary to decide which of the two aspects is to be studied in advance.
a threefold challenge
like other sectors like healthcare, retail, capital market, energy and many more, academia sees the potential of big data. to harness this potential, academics face a threefold challenge: generate teams with varied expertise, work on very focused yet meaningful research problems, while taking ethical questions into account. many such efforts are appearing in academia, and we are, hopefully, to expect a great breakthrough in the near future.","['academia', 'researcher', 'decision', 'maker', 'policy', 'maker', 'manage', 'challenge', 'broader', 'collaboration', 'privacy', 'harness', 'value',

103,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/sales-forecasting-in-retail/,Methods for Sales Forecasting in Retail - Blackcoffer Insights,"introductioninventory planning is a fundamental part of retail operations. proper retail inventory management, which helps to balance supply and demand, relies heavily on an accurate forecast of future demand. in fact, sales forecasting refers to predicting future demand (or sales), assuming that the factors which affected demand in the past and are affecting the present will still have an influence in the future. it is an important task but is very difficult to accomplish.in the retailing industry, which is defined as the retailing business of products including apparel, shoes, and fashion beauty products, forecasting itself can be treated like a service which represents the set of analytical tools that facilitate the companies to make the best decisions for predicting the future. undoubtedly, a good forecasting service system can help to avoid understocking or over-stocking in retail inventory planning, which further relates to other critical operations of the whole supply chain such as due date management, production planning, pricing, and achieving high customer service level. in order to achieve economics sustainability under a highly competitive environment, a company should adopt a consumer-demand driven pull operational strategy which means forecasting becomes a critically important task.compared to other retailing service industries, it is well argued that sales forecasting is a very difficult task in fashion retailing because fashion products demand is highly volatile with the ever-changing taste of the consumers and the fashion products life cycle is very short. in addition, the sales of fashion products are strongly affected stochastically by seasonal factors, fashion trend factors, and many tricky variables (e.g., weather, marketing strategy, political climate, item features, and macroeconomic trend). these, together with the fact that fashion retailers are carrying a large number of stock-keeping units (skus) with limited historical sales data, all make sales forecasting challenging and call for more sophisticated and versatile analytical tools. on the other hand, it is known that the fashion apparel supply chain is a relatively long one which includes upstream cotton plants, fiber manufacturers, apparel factories, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. as a consequence, the notorious bullwhip effect will have a particularly strong influence on the fashion supply chain. since forecasting is a critical factor relating to the presence and significance of the bullwhip effect, improving forecasting can help reduce the bullwhip effect which directly enhances the efficiency of the fashion supply chain.statistical fashion sales forecasting methodstraditionally, fashion sales forecasting is accomplished by statistical methods. in fact, a lot of statistical methods have been used for sales forecasting, which includes linear regression, moving average, weighted average, exponential smoothing (used when a trend is present but not linear), exponential smoothing with the trend, double exponential smoothing, bayesian analysis, and so forth.statistical time series analysis tools such as arima and sarima are widely employed in sales forecasting. since these methods have a closed form expression for forecasting, it is simple and easy to implement and the results can be computed very quickly.ai fashion retail sales forecasting methodsthe pure statistical models have a deficiency in conducting fashion retail forecasting, in order to improve forecasting accuracy. ai methods emerge with the advance of computer technology. in fact, ai models can efficiently derive arbitrarily nonlinear approximation functions directly from the data. popular methods such as artificial neural network (ann) models and fuzzy logic models are commonly employed in the literature and they are the first kind of models being employed for fashion retail sales forecasting. to be specific, ann models have been developed and they provide satisfactory results in different domains.hybrid methods for fashion sales forecastinghybrid forecasting methods are usually developed based on the fact that they can utilize the strengths of different models together to form a new forecasting method. as such, many of them are considered to be more efficient than pure statistical models and pure ai models. it is not surprising that in recent years, a number of research works examine hybrid forecasting methods. hybrid methods employed in the fashion forecasting literature often combine different schemes such as fuzzy model, ann, and elm with other techniques such as statistical models, the grey model (gm), and so forth. following are more adapted hybrid methods:fuzzy logic based hybrid methodsneural network based hybrid methodselm based hybrid methodsapplications in the fashion industrysales forecasting is a real-world problem in fashion retailing. from the perspective on applications and implementation, various issues are identified.in terms of the forecasting horizon, most of the existing forecasting models are suitable for middle-term and long-term forecasting. however, short-term forecasting, including the very short term forecasting such as real-time forecasting, is not yet fully explored. this kind of short-term forecasting is very important given the nature of the fashion industry (the fashion trend is unpredictable, and the lead time is very short).
regarding the product type to be forecasted, two kinds of products are involved, namely, the existing product and a new product. compared to the existing products forecasting, prediction on new product forecasting seems to be much more complicated and difficult, due to the absence of historical sales data.
in terms of speed, in general, statistical methods can output the forecasting results very quickly. ai methods are usually more time-consuming. in the past, the lead time in the fashion industry is a bit longer than now, and the lead time can be ten months or even one year. however, the fashion industry has changed and fast fashion companies like zara, h&m, and mango are adopting quick response strategy with a very short lead time (e.g., 2 weeks in zara for some products). as a result, forecasting result must be available within a very short time for any forecasting application for these companies.

detect data-exfiltration over the network is a challenge. existing perimeter security solutions and end-system security are not effectively devised to handle insider attack and data exfiltration. issues such as misconfiguration, vulnerable points, and covert network channels lead to data-exfiltration. hence, building an effective system for detecting insider attacks remains an open challenge. devising an exclusive behavior-based model is essential to detect data-exfiltration over the network by utilizing parameters from both system and network.2.motivationnowadays thousands of companies and organizations have been subject to a cyber-attack. many hackers that exist outside of a company or an organization hacking and breaking into information systems to execute these cyber-attacks. but nowadays insiders that are hackers exist inside of a company or an organization are becoming a big problem and insiders are often overloaded as potential threats to commit cyber-attack.usually we apply some kind of security policies and access control policies which are aimed to prevent our data, business policy, product information, secret information, etc. but still sometimes it fails, because when we trust someone and give him/her full access to network, host, etc., they usually try to leak our data or information. this is the reason that we say, insider attacks are often more damaging and costly due to the knowledge of and access to information system. from the recent survey done by many institutions and researchers in 2010 and 2011, we know that more than a quarter of cyber-attacks were done by insiders.3. insider threatan insider threat is a malicious hacker (also called a cracker or a black hat) who is an employee or officer of a business, institution, or agency. insider threats are often disgruntled employees or ex-employees who believe that the business, institution, or agency has done them wrong and feel justified in gaining revenge.it is difficult to detect and prevent, attacks by people with legitimate access to an organizations computers and networks represent a growing problem in our digital world. these insider threats frustrate employers who lack the resources to identify them and monitor their behavior. insiders are not just employees: today they can include contractors, business partners, auditors even an alumnus with a valid email address.define an insider as a trusted entity that is given the power to violate a security policy. the insider is determined in reference to an established security policy. insider threat lies in the access and ability to: violate a security policy using legitimate access and violate an access control policy by obtaining unauthorized access.4. insider typethere are different types of insiders that result in information leakage: inadvertent, intentional and malicious. an inadvertent insider is a trusted person with access to sensitive information who inadvertently discloses sensitive information. an intentional insider is a trusted person who knowingly discloses sensitive information and is aware of the security that it is purposefully bypassing. this person may try to manipulate the content or use overt communication that preserves privacy to avoid detection. a malicious insider is also a trusted person who knowingly discloses sensitive information. however, in addition to manipulating the content or using overt communication like an international insider, tunneled or covert communication is usually employed to avoid detection.5. data-exfiltrationif we talk in terms of our general life, exfiltrate means to surreptitiously move personnel or material out an area under enemy control. in terms of computer science, data exfiltration is the unauthorized removal of data from a network. e.g. leakage of archives, passwords, additional malware and utilities, personally identifiable information, financial data, trade secrets, source code, intellectual property, etc. for a hacker, it is easy to move things in a box. e.g. rar file, zip file, cab file, etc. data exfiltration via outbound ftp, is most common these days. data-exfiltration through network medium is most common. for example, ftp, smtp, ssh, instant messenger, rootkits, batnets, spyware, covert channels, phishing, pharming, mitm are the medium by which data-exfiltration is quite simple for insider. exploits, privilege escalation, dns poisoning, directory traversal are common attack done by an insider. if we talk about physical medium of data-exfiltration is also play a major role. for example, printing device, cd, dvd, disc, usp, laptop, etc. are the common medium used by an insider for data-exfiltration.6. the solution to detecting data exfiltration over the networkpresenting a behavior approach based on a chi-square model to detect insider attack specifically, data-exfiltration. the approach focuses on both technical as well as behavioral aspects and present methods to detect data-exfiltration. firstly during the learning phase, profile each host in a network and compute chi-square values individually for the system and network parameters. secondly, during the detection phase, compute chi-square values for the identified parameters and then superimpose current chi-square values with the learned chi-square values to detect data-exfiltration over the network.aim to develop a method to identify abnormal cyber behavior by establishing user profiles based on cyber data that is collected from the user while active on a computer. to do this, implement learning algorithms to establish normal behavioral profiles for users. monitor users for anomalies in their behavior patterns. it is important to state that our goal is to identify these abnormalities. for example, it can identify that a user is uploading an abnormally large amount of file from a directory that they do not typically access.fig. 1: superimposed chi-square values of outgoing packets of live data (abnormal profile data) and threshold_1, threshold_2 and threshold_3 of learned data (normal profile data) for user type 1, 2 and 3 respectively.fig. 2:","['probleminsider', 'threat',

105,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/data-exfiltration/,What is Data Exfiltration? - Blackcoffer Insights,"if we talk in terms of our general life, exfiltrate means to surreptitiously move personnel or material out an area under enemy control. in terms of computer science, data exfiltration is the unauthorized removal of data from a network e.g. leakage of archives, passwords, additional malware and utilities, personally identifiable information, financial data, trade secrets, source code, intellectual property, etc. for a hacker, it is easy to move things in a box. e.g. rar file, zip file, cab file, etc. data exfiltration via outbound ftp, is most common these days.covert channelsource: main characteristic of a covert channel is that it is aimed at hiding the fact that communication is taking place. this differs from cryptography, where there is no intention to camouflage the transmission of data, but rather the goal is to make the data readable/useable solely to the receiver. the oldest form of a covert channel is steganography, where the intention is to avoid drawing suspicion to the transmission of a hidden message.source: channels evolved from tattooing messages on a slaves scalp to embedding information into features of the tcp/ip protocol. although a formal definition of covertness in the field of computer science does not exist, research on the detection of covert communication is very active. informally, we can say that an operation is more covert if it is difficult to detect without the use of special tools that specifically look for it.for example, let us suppose that we want to detect a user who is printing documents on a particular printer over the network (for convenience, we will refer to such a user simply as john). suppose that we do not set up any network tools to keep records of any communication between johns workstation and the printer. the only way to detect if john prints something is to see if he walks to the printer to pick up the page. alternatively, we may detect that every time we try to print something, we discover that the printer is frequently busy and that john is waiting for his print jobs to complete. if john wants to keep the operation hidden he should just print at a lower rate, say one page per day. nobody would detect it. if instead he keeps printing all day long, at the highest possible rate, the operation becomes easily recognizable. even printing at half the maximum rate makes the process quite noticeable.if we abstract this concept, we obtain the following: covertness is a characteristic of an operation that can be measured by the rate of usage of the media. if the apparatus is exploited at its maximum capacity, the operation is easily visible with a covertness of zero; if instead it is exploited at a lesser rate, the operation will be increasingly covert. in other words, a measure of covertness is some function of distance from the capacity for a given medium. therefore, to keep activity as covert as possible, the rate of usage, compared to the capacity of the equipment, should be kept as low as possible.the closer the capacity is to the rate at which the operation or transmission is executed, the more covert the transmission will be. covertness is thus proportional to the difference between capacity and the actual rate used:covertness = (capacity of the medium transmission rate)define three kinds of threats:the unauthorized disclosure of information

106,https://insights.blackcoffer.com/impacts-of-covid-19-on-vegetable-vendors-and-food-stalls/,Impacts of COVID 19 on Food products - Blackcoffer Insights,"some vendors (fruit and vegetable sellers) began venturing out after a few days without explicit permission and immediately faced police harassment. after a few weeks, the government eased restrictions and essential vendors werebeing permitted to vend(due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks). however, the cost of doing business, as well as the risk, has gone up significantly, with vendors not having access to wholesale markets and suppliers and having to spend more on travel costs due to travel restrictions in place in the city. also, with the lockdown still partially in place, the number of buyers has gone down and so have earnings. due to the harsh summer heat, perishable fruits and vegetables also have a reduced shelf life so vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have.the state has recently announced astimulus package of inr 5000 crore for nearly 50 lakh vendors, acknowledging the grave impact of their loss of livelihood. the intended relief for vendors will be a credit loan that will provide an initial working capital of inr 10,000 for all vendors, but this is not sufficient. instead of credit, the government should think of converting it into direct income benefit, a cash grant, as livelihood support to start the income activity regularly. the vendors need income support to be able to restart work, and if they are not able to do so, how will they return the loan. in the face of the ever-changing crisis, vendor organizations have to step forward and advocate for vendors to be provided the resources they need to be able to resume their livelihoods. to this end, vendors organizations could consider the following for an advocacy agenda:livelihood promotion for all vendors, including those selling non-essential goods: the impact of covid-19 has been very harsh on informal workers who have exhausted their capital and earnings in trying to feed themselves during the extended lockdown period. vendors need to be able to resume vending for survival and the government should take steps to begin to reopen markets and allow vendors back on the streets.reopening of markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene: delhi has many different types of traditionally crowded markets including weekly markets (for fresh food, cooked food and essential household items) and daily markets that operate on the sides of roads. these markets will need to resume keeping in mind the need for social distancing and the government should release guidelines for the same. going forward, vending zones must also be designed keeping in mind the need for social distancing and for sufficient hygiene facilities (running water, washing stations and toilets). the authorities should work with town vending committees (tvcs) for the same.provide direct support which is de-linked from existing registration requirements: as lockdown is lifted and vending resumes, vendors who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to resume their work. the government stimulus package, while a welcome step, is insufficient in the nature of relief (credit not direct cash transfer) and eligibility (only registered vendors are eligible, which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country). in addition, government relief and support needs to be de-linked from very rigid registration requirements, as very few vendors have been registered in india. in delhi, out of roughly 300,000 street vendors, only about 131,00 have some form of occupational identification. if the criteria for any kind of cash grant or livelihood support is linked to occupational identification by the state, then the government should also accept registration with a workers organisation/union as a proxy for government-issued vending passes.ensuring hygiene and social distancing at sites of vending: the government needs to take steps for provision of running water and soap/sanitisers for street vendors at their place of work. additionally, vendor organisations should work with food safety authorities in the country to train vendors (especially cooked food vendors) in ways to maintain hygiene while working.taking steps to survey and register more vendors for access to government benefits: as mentioned earlier, the number of vendors who have some form of identification are a fraction of the actual population of vendors in delhi. before the crisis and subsequent lockdown, the town vending committees (tvcs) were supposed to start surveying and registering vendors. as we get used to the new normal, the process of survey and registration should also begin to ensure that all vendors are able to access social security benefits and financial aid during this period of crisis.","['vendor', 'fruit', 'vegetable',
