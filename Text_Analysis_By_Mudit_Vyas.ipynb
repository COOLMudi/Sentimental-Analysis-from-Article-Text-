vegetable sellers) began venturing out after a few days without explicit permission and immediately faced police harassment. After a few weeks, the government eased restrictions and essential vendors were\\xc2\\xa0being permitted to vend\\xc2\\xa0(due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks). However, the cost of doing business, as well as the risk, has gone up significantly, with vendors not having access to wholesale markets and suppliers and having to spend more on travel costs due to travel restrictions in place in the city. Also, with the lockdown still partially in place, the number of buyers has gone down and so have earnings. Due to the harsh summer heat, perishable fruits and vegetables also have a reduced shelf life so vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The state has recently announced a\\xc2\\xa0stimulus package of INR 5000 crore for nearly 50 lakh vendors, acknowledging the grave impact of their loss of livelihood. The intended relief for vendors will be a credit loan that will provide an initial working capital of INR 10,000 for all vendors, but this is not sufficient. Instead of credit, the government should think of converting it into direct income benefit, a cash grant, as livelihood support to start the income activity regularly. The vendors need income support to be able to restart work, and if they are not able to do so, how will they return the loan. In the face of the ever-changing crisis, vendor organizations have to step forward and advocate for vendors to be provided the resources they need to be able to resume their livelihoods. To this end, vendors organizations could consider the following for an advocacy agenda:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Livelihood promotion for all vendors, including those selling non-essential goods: The impact of COVID-19 has been very harsh on informal workers who have exhausted their capital and earnings in trying to feed themselves during the extended lockdown period. Vendors need to be able to resume vending for survival and the government should take steps to begin to reopen markets and allow vendors back on the streets.</li><li>Reopening of Markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene: Delhi has many different types of traditionally crowded markets including weekly markets (for fresh food, cooked food and essential household items) and daily markets that operate on the sides of roads. These markets will need to resume keeping in mind the need for social distancing and the government should release guidelines for the same. Going forward, vending zones must also be designed keeping in mind the need for social distancing and for sufficient hygiene facilities (running water, washing stations and toilets). The authorities should work with Town Vending Committees (TVCs) for the same.</li><li>Provide direct support which is de-linked from existing registration requirements: As lockdown is lifted and vending resumes, vendors who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to resume their work. The government stimulus package, while a welcome step, is insufficient in the nature of relief (credit not direct cash transfer) and eligibility (only registered vendors are eligible, which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country). In addition, government relief and support needs to be de-linked from very rigid registration requirements, as very few vendors have been registered in India. In Delhi, out of roughly 300,000 street vendors, only about 131,00 have some form of occupational identification. If the criteria for any kind of cash grant or livelihood support is linked to occupational identification by the state, then the government should also accept registration with a workers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 organisation/union as a proxy for government-issued vending passes.</li><li>Ensuring hygiene and social distancing at sites of vending: The government needs to take steps for provision of running water and soap/sanitisers for street vendors at their place of work. Additionally, vendor organisations should work with food safety authorities in the country to train vendors (especially cooked food vendors) in ways to maintain hygiene while working.</li><li>Taking steps to survey and register more vendors for access to government benefits: As mentioned earlier, the number of vendors who have some form of identification are a fraction of the actual population of vendors in Delhi. Before the crisis and subsequent lockdown, the Town Vending Committees (TVCs) were supposed to start surveying and registering vendors. As we get used to the new normal, the process of survey and registration should also begin to ensure that all vendors are able to access social security benefits and financial aid during this period of crisis.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">Blackcoffer Insights 34: Parth Goyal, IET DAVV</pre>\\n    </div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n    <footer>\\r\\n                \\r\\n

            "<p>Some vendors (fruit and vegetable sellers) began venturing out after a few days without explicit permission and immediately faced police harassment. After a few weeks, the government eased restrictions and essential vendors were being permitted to vend (due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks). However, the cost of doing business, as well as the risk, has gone up significantly, with vendors not having access to wholesale markets and suppliers and having to spend more on travel costs due to travel restrictions in place in the city. Also, with the lockdown still partially in place, the number of buyers has gone down and so have earnings. Due to the harsh summer heat, perishable fruits and vegetables also have a reduced shelf life so vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have.</p>\n",
            "<p>The state has recently announced a stimulus package of INR 5000 crore for nearly 50 lakh vendors, acknowledging the grave impact of their loss of livelihood. The intended relief for vendors will be a credit loan that will provide an initial working capital of INR 10,000 for all vendors, but this is not sufficient. Instead of credit, the government should think of converting it into direct income benefit, a cash grant, as livelihood support to start the income activity regularly. The vendors need income support to be able to restart work, and if they are not able to do so, how will they return the loan. In the face of the ever-changing crisis, vendor organizations have to step forward and advocate for vendors to be provided the resources they need to be able to resume their livelihoods. To this end, vendors organizations could consider the following for an advocacy agenda:</p>\n",
            "<ul><li>Livelihood promotion for all vendors, including those selling non-essential goods: The impact of COVID-19 has been very harsh on informal workers who have exhausted their capital and earnings in trying to feed themselves during the extended lockdown period. Vendors need to be able to resume vending for survival and the government should take steps to begin to reopen markets and allow vendors back on the streets.</li><li>Reopening of Markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene: Delhi has many different types of traditionally crowded markets including weekly markets (for fresh food, cooked food and essential household items) and daily markets that operate on the sides of roads. These markets will need to resume keeping in mind the need for social distancing and the government should release guidelines for the same. Going forward, vending zones must also be designed keeping in mind the need for social distancing and for sufficient hygiene facilities (running water, washing stations and toilets). The authorities should work with Town Vending Committees (TVCs) for the same.</li><li>Provide direct support which is de-linked from existing registration requirements: As lockdown is lifted and vending resumes, vendors who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to resume their work. The government stimulus package, while a welcome step, is insufficient in the nature of relief (credit not direct cash transfer) and eligibility (only registered vendors are eligible, which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country). In addition, government relief and support needs to be de-linked from very rigid registration requirements, as very few vendors have been registered in India. In Delhi, out of roughly 300,000 street vendors, only about 131,00 have some form of occupational identification. If the criteria for any kind of cash grant or livelihood support is linked to occupational identification by the state, then the government should also accept registration with a workers’ organisation/union as a proxy for government-issued vending passes.</li><li>Ensuring hygiene and social distancing at sites of vending: The government needs to take steps for provision of running water and soap/sanitisers for street vendors at their place of work. Additionally, vendor organisations should work with food safety authorities in the country to train vendors (especially cooked food vendors) in ways to maintain hygiene while working.</li><li>Taking steps to survey and register more vendors for access to government benefits: As mentioned earlier, the number of vendors who have some form of identification are a fraction of the actual population of vendors in Delhi. Before the crisis and subsequent lockdown, the Town Vending Committees (TVCs) were supposed to start surveying and registering vendors. As we get used to the new normal, the process of survey and registration should also begin to ensure that all vendors are able to access social security benefits and financial aid during this period of crisis.</li></ul>\n",

These markets will need to resume keeping in mind the need for social distancing and the government should release guidelines for the same. Going forward, vending zones must also be designed keeping in mind the need for social distancing and for sufficient hygiene facilities (running water, washing stations and toilets).

The government stimulus package, while a welcome step, is insufficient in the nature of relief (credit not direct cash transfer) and eligibility (only registered vendors are eligible, which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country). In addition, government relief and support needs to be de-linked from very rigid registration requirements, as very few vendors have been registered in India. In Delhi, out of roughly 300,000 street vendors, only about 131,00 have some form of occupational identification. If the criteria for any kind of cash grant or livelihood support is linked to occupational identification by the state, then the government should also accept registration with a workers’ organisation/union as a proxy for government-issued vending passes.</li><li>Ensuring hygiene and social distancing at sites of vending: The government needs to take steps for provision of running water and soap/sanitisers for street vendors at their place of work. Additionally, vendor organisations should work with food safety authorities in the country to train vendors (especially cooked food vendors) in ways to maintain hygiene while working.</li><li>Taking steps to survey and register more vendors for access to government benefits: As mentioned earlier, the number of vendors who have some form of identification are a fraction of the actual population of vendors in Delhi. Before the crisis and subsequent lockdown, the Town Vending Committees (TVCs) were supposed to start surveying and registering vendors.

However, the cost of doing business, as well as the risk, has gone up significantly, with vendors not having access to wholesale markets and suppliers and having to spend more on travel costs due to travel restrictions in place in the city. Also, with the lockdown still partially in place, the number of buyers has gone down and so have earnings. Due to the harsh summer heat, perishable fruits and vegetables also have a reduced shelf life so vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have.The state has recently announced a stimulus package of INR 5000 crore for nearly 50 lakh vendors, acknowledging the grave impact of their loss of livelihood. The intended relief for vendors will be a credit loan that will provide an initial working capital of INR 10,000 for all vendors, but this is not sufficient. Instead of credit, the government should think of converting it into direct income benefit, a cash grant, as livelihood support to start the income activity regularly. The vendors need income support to be able to restart work, and if they are not able to do so, how will they return the loan. In the face of the ever-changing crisis, vendor organizations have to step forward and advocate for vendors to be provided the resources they need to be able to resume their livelihoods. To this end, vendors organizations could consider the following for an advocacy agenda:Livelihood promotion for all vendors, including those selling non-essential goods: The impact of COVID-19 has been very harsh on informal workers who have exhausted their capital and earnings in trying to feed themselves during the extended lockdown period. Vendors need to be able to resume vending for survival and the government should take steps to begin to reopen markets and allow vendors back on the streets.Reopening of Markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene: Delhi has many different types of traditionally crowded markets including weekly markets (for fresh food, cooked food and essential household items) and daily markets that operate on the sides of roads. These markets will need to resume keeping in mind the need for social distancing and the government should release guidelines for the same. Going forward, vending zones must also be designed keeping in mind the need for social distancing and for sufficient hygiene facilities (running water, washing stations and toilets). The authorities should work with Town Vending Committees (TVCs) for the same.Provide direct support which is de-linked from existing registration requirements: As lockdown is lifted and vending resumes, vendors who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to resume their work. The government stimulus package, while a welcome step, is insufficient in the nature of relief (credit not direct cash transfer) and eligibility (only registered vendors are eligible, which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country). In addition, government relief and support needs to be de-linked from very rigid registration requirements, as very few vendors have been registered in India. In Delhi, out of roughly 300,000 street vendors, only about 131,00 have some form of occupational identification. If the criteria for any kind of cash grant or livelihood support is linked to occupational identification by the state, then the government should also accept registration with a workers’ organisation/union as a proxy for government-issued vending passes.Ensuring hygiene and social distancing at sites of vending: The government needs to take steps for provision of running water and soap/sanitisers for street vendors at their place of work. Additionally, vendor organisations should work with food safety authorities in the country to train vendors (especially cooked food vendors) in ways to maintain hygiene while working.Taking steps to survey and register more vendors for access to government benefits: As mentioned earlier, the number of vendors who have some form of identification are a fraction of the actual population of vendors in Delhi.

Given the importance of the retail food environment in establishing and sustaining healthy diets, interruptions to specific aspects of it, such as the availability of fresh vegetables, could have a negative influence on population health, which has already been noted as a source of worry.', 'Despite the dominance of national and international supermarket chains, warehouse clubs, and supercenters in grocery ', 'retail', ', vegetables are offered in a number of other food retail settings. Fresh vegetable #vendors are typically smaller and more community-oriented than other restaurant or retail food outlets and can include chain or independent grocery stores, greengrocers, storefront stands, street carts, and even makeshift platforms dedicated to the sale of fresh vegetables. Smaller community fresh vegetable vendors who may conduct business on the sides of major streets or on storefronts have played an integral role in the food environment in large urban centers such as New York City (NYC), particularly in ethnic enclaves, despite the fact that fresh produce does not have a significantly higher nutritional value and fresh produce can also be purchased at these larger food retailers.', 'Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, many fresh fruit and vegetable vendors, notably street carts selling fresh vegetables in cities across the United States, including New York City, have been forced to close owing to a combination of falling demand and fear of catching COVID-19. The importance of fresh vegetable vendors varies by neighborhood within cities. Furthermore, these fresh vegetable vendors attract visitors and interborough shoppers from a variety of cultural backgrounds not only Asian ones who are looking for things that are not available elsewhere in the city or for the same low prices.', 'These fresh vegetable vendors, unlike larger, well-established grocery store vendors, may not have the financial infrastructure to sustain the shifts in ', 'supply ', 'and ', 'demand ', 'produced by the COVID-19 epidemic; consequently, the danger of closure or modifications in services may be greater for these vendors.', 'In order to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ', 'services', ' offered by fresh vegetable vendors, surveillance #data from both before and after the pandemic’s inception is required.', 'After a few days, vegetable dealers began venturing out without explicit permission and were quickly harassed by police. After a few weeks, the government relaxed the limitations, allowing vital traders to sell their wares (due in large part to the advocacy of vendor organizations and activist networks). However, the cost of doing business has increased dramatically, as vendors no longer have access to wholesale markets and suppliers, and they must spend more on travel expenditures owing to city-imposed travel limitations. Furthermore, with the partial lockdown still in place, the number of buyers has decreased, as have earnings. Perishable vegetables have a shorter shelf life in the summer heat, thus vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have.', 'Consider the situation of Delhi at the starting of COVID 19. The state has launched an INR 5000 crore stimulus package for over 50 lakh vendors, realizing the serious consequences of their loss of livelihood. The targeted relief for vendors is a credit facility that will provide all sellers with an initial working capital of INR 10,000, but this will not be enough. Instead of credit, the government should consider changing it into a direct income benefit, such as a cash grant, to help people start earning money on a regular basis. The vendors require income support in order to resume work, and how will they repay the loan if they are unable to do so? Vendor organizations must step forth in the face of the ever-changing crises and lobby for vendors to be given the resources they need to continue their livelihoods. Vendor organizations could use the following as part of their advocacy agenda:', 'Promotion of vendors’ livelihoods, particularly those selling non-essential goods: COVID-19 has had a particularly painful impact on informal labourers, who have spent all of their savings and wages trying to feed themselves during the prolonged lockdown. Vendors must be permitted to restart peddling in order to survive, and the government should take steps to reopen marketplaces and reintroduce vendors to the streets.', 'Market reopening with social distance and hygiene in mind: Delhi features a variety of typically crowded markets, including weekly markets (for fresh food, cooked meals, and necessary household items) and daily markets on the sides of highways. These markets will need to resume considering the necessity for social separation, and the government should issue recommendations in this regard. In the future, vending zones must be planned with social distancing in mind, as well as adequate sanitary facilities (running water, washing stations and toilets). For this, the government should collaborate with Town Vending Committees (TVCs).', 'Provide direct assistance that is not tied to existing registration requirements: When the lockdown is lifted and vending starts, vendors who have been at home for months will require direct income benefits in order to return to work. While the government stimulus plan is a positive step, it falls short in terms of assistance (credit rather than direct cash transfer) and eligibility (only registered vendors are eligible, which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country). Furthermore, government assistance and support must be divorced from the country’s strict registration requirements, as only a few vendors have been registered in India. Only about 131,00 of Delhi’s 300,000 street sellers have any type of employment identity. If the state requires occupational identity for any type of monetary grant or livelihood assistance, the government should accept registration with a workers’ organization/union as a surrogate for government-issued vending passes.', 'Providing flowing water and soap/sanitizers to street sellers at their place of business: The government should take steps to provide street vendors with running water and soap/sanitizers at their place of business. Additionally, vendor organizations should collaborate with local food safety authorities to instruct vendors (particularly those selling prepared foods) on how to maintain hygiene while on the job.', 'Taking measures to conduct a survey and register additional vendors for government assistance: As previously stated, the number of sellers with some sort of identity is a small percentage of the total number of vendors in Delhi. The Town Vending Committees (TVCs) were expected to begin surveying and registering vendors before the crisis and ensuing lockout. As we adjust to the new normal, the survey and registration procedure should begin to guarantee that all vendors have access to social security benefits and financial assistance during this difficult time.', 'Finally, some fresh vegetable sellers may have shuttered for a period of time early in the epidemic, only to reopen recently. Alternatively, vendors may have launched soon after the in-person checks were completed, but still within the June-July 2020 endpoint timeframe. This is a drawback of the method; in order to offer the most reliable COVID-19 pandemic monitoring data, data must be collected in a short period of time.'])\n",

Due to this increase for pursuit for happiness at home, it might be likely that tourists will avoid traveling because they don’t feel the urge to break-free and move away for a holiday.', 'Now, let us look at different types of holiday revellers.

Initiating in China in late December 2019, the virus has since then spread to every corner of the world, infecting millions in its wake. Countries around the world have responded by shutting down their economies and advocating lockdowns of varying degrees. India has arguably had one of the most stringent lockdowns of all countries, restricting the movement of people, goods and effectively transforming every city into a ghost town.', 'Due to such stringent restrictions on movement, the economy has received a fatal blow. The virus arrived in India at a time when the country was already in strife, dealing with a slowing GDP growth rate and an ever-increasing fiscal deficit. The lockdown has simply exacerbated the economic predicament; pushing multiple businesses and industries to a moribund state. Other countries have also faced a similar predicament, particularly in the US and Europe, both being hotspots for virus transmission.', 'However, upon taking a closer look at the global economy, there seems to have been an upward mobilization in some of the sectors in the IT domain. These sectors seem to have exorbitantly increased their scale of operations and have overall reaped hefty profits. So what is it that differentiates these areas from the rest and what can we learn from them?', 'A path to victory', 'If we look at the evolving IT/ITeS industry around the world, the domains that have flourished in this strenuous time all have had one key characteristic in common; flexibility. These sectors have adopted a more flexible approach to dealing with the lockdown. Be it flexible working procedures or adopting newer, more advanced ways of working in line with the requirements of our time, they haven’t shied away from changing the rules of the game. Let’s look at some of these areas within the tech domain that have been successful in conquering the lockdown.', 'Social Media', 'Lockdowns around the globe have confined people inside their homes, with nothing much to do of significance. As a result, social networking sites have reported a gigantic rise in user engagement over the lockdown period. Reportedly, there has been close to a 50% rise in daily text transmissions across messaging platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp in the hardest-hit economies. Twitter has reported a 23% increase in its user base as compared to last year. The data makes it evident that social media platforms are here to reap the benefits of a lockdown situation.', 'Video consumption sites such as YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok are in line to reap massive profits. It’s no wonder that viewership on these platforms has increased manifolds due to lockdowns. These platforms serve to be a distraction from the tragedies of the real world in such stressing times and offer an easy escape. Be it rumors regarding the cure for COVID 19, gossips, or rap battles; these platforms provide viewers with their much-needed dose of distractions. As they say, “ignorance is bliss”.', 'Data-Mining Enterprises', 'The lockdown has proven to be a miracle for data-mining companies. With such an exorbitant increase in the number of hours spent online globally, these firms now have access to significantly larger sets of data than they otherwise could ever have. Widespread implementation of data-mining has been seen recently with most countries opting for Government-regulated surveillance applications that monitor your movement at all times. Moreover, these applications have access to your personal information as well as medical records. Countries such as South Korea and Singapore are at the helm of relying on such means to control the outbreak.', 'Although noble, such initiatives do raise a red flag with regards to user privacy. The public has been provided with very little information about how these applications operate and what goes on behind the scenes. This creates an atmosphere of obscurity that is frankly harmful to the premise of a democracy.', 'Cloud Computing', 'Cloud computing has been on the rise for the last couple of years. However, the pandemic has made it the de facto king in terms of computational services. With an increasing reliance on remote working, the ability to store data in one secure location has turned out to be critical.', 'The cloud computing services such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud have reaped hefty profits in the process. The emerging landscape in the tech world seems to suggest an upward trend in reliability on these services as far as large scale data storage and computing is concerned.', 'E-Commerce', 'Social distancing measures have made it practically impossible for people to physically go shopping for groceries and other necessities. Moreover, a majority of retail outlets in cities have reported negligible engagement, for the fear of transmission of the virus. E-commerce sites have been the real winners in this predicament of global consumerism.', 'With high standards of hygiene and at-home delivery, these sites have provided an easy alternative to retail stores. Other similar businesses include food delivery apps and grocery sites that are also flourishing today amidst the pandemic. Recent weeks have made it evident that E-commerce websites are well on their way to abolish traditional shopping methods.', 'OTT Platforms', 'Online streaming platforms consist of a relatively newer approach to entertainment; having only been in existence for the past couple of years. They had already, however, established a name for themselves before the lockdowns. Sites such as Netflix and Amazon Prime had been dominating a chunk of the market share and competing heavily with movie theatres for new releases, for a while now. Now with the lockdown practically deleting theatres and cable TV from the collective psyche of the entertainment industry, they are well on their way to becoming the platform of choice as far as entertainment for the masses is concerned.', 'This has already become evident, with Zee5 India reporting a whopping 80% increase in subscriptions and a 50% increase in the time spent on their site, within the first couple of weeks of the lockdown itself. Another such platform MUBI reported a 28% rise in its viewership in India only a week after lockdown commenced. These facts are a clear indication of the exponential growth that is in store for these platforms, which is unlikely to change anytime soon.', 'Video-Conferencing Platforms', 'The idea of working from home is all set to be the new norm in our professional culture, which requires an easy and effective way to communicate over the internet. Not just audio or text, but video conferencing is the need today. Hence it’s understandable why multiple video conferencing services are set to reap massive profits off of the new norm.', 'Arguably the most popular of these, Zoom has reported a 130% increase in its price share since the beginning of 2020. Another such platform known as the Microsoft Teams collaboration suite, operated by Microsoft, has reported a whopping 12 million increase in its user base in the very first week of the lockdown in the US. This data is only likely to have an upwards trajectory considering the increasing pace at which industries are going online.', 'The Indian Picture', 'The Indian IT landscape has also undergone massive cultural changes. According to Rajesh Gopinathan, chief executive officer and managing director of Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., the “work from home” model of operations is here to stay. He also claimed that the firms only requires a 25% workforce to be physically present for any project at any of the locations.', 'Tata Consultancy Services which is one of the major players in the Indian IT landscape has shifted almost 90% of its workforce into a remote borderless workspace model, and other smaller firms have followed suit. What it tells us is that we’re headed in a direction we’re unlikely to return from. Remote working appears to be the modern protocol for operations and is unlikely to change anytime soon.', 'However, a major challenge often overlooked in such circumstances is that of an adaptable culture. The culture of workspaces has to be drastically altered and members of the workforce have to dive headfirst into the new way of doing business. This is critical to ensure that the industry can combat the pandemic and recover gloriously.', 'A duality unlike any other', 'The lockdown has presented us with a stark contrast unlike any other we’ve witnessed. Where on the one hand, the industries mentioned above seem to be exhibiting exponential growth with their people thriving and having every possible resource at their disposal, the unorganized sector and the MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises) seem to be at the crux of death.', 'The sector that consists of people for whom having guidelines to work from home is irrelevant as that was never really an option; people with no fixed wages or social security to fall back on during this time of crisis. As a result of the lockdown, several of these MSMEs have effectively become inoperable and have resorted to massive layoffs just to survive. This has resulted in thousands of workers losing their jobs with nowhere to go to for refuge. A chunk of these people includes migrant workers who have lost their jobs and are left with little to no avenue to feed themselves. Not receiving significant support from the government, these people have been initiating treks back to their villages. What is witnessed is a massive influx of migrant workers flooding the highways, walking weeks to find shelter and food. Truck drivers responsible for delivering goods have also resigned stating that they have no means to eat because of the closure of every food joint on the highways. Both these realities present a stark contrast and expose a deep crack in our societal framework. One I reckon won’t heal anytime soon.', 'A train Unlikely to Halt', 'The COVID 19 pandemic has restructured our social fabric in a way that is unlikely to change anytime soon. The areas that we’ve discussed are likely to become the flagbearers of the digital revolution of the decade. An upward mobilization with regards to massive scale movement of industries online seems pertinent today being led by these domains in the IT industry. An unfortunate consequence of it is that a majority of the MSMEs may soon cease to exist, having been replaced by some of the other alternatives that we’ve discussed. It seems to be a never-ending circle where the ones who are making a profit out of this situation will continue to do so, while the others will be washed out from our collective memory.'])\n",
            "('https://insights.blackcoffer.com/online-gaming-adolescent-online-gaming-effects-demotivated-depression-musculoskeletal-and-psychosomatic-symptoms/', 'Online gaming: Adolescent online gaming effects us | how', ['Introduction\\xa0', 'A video game is any software program that can be played on a computing device, such as a personal computer, gaming console, or mobile device. Video games have been in existence since the early 1970s and have become increasingly popular, spanning different mobile (smartphones, tablets) and stationary (computer or console) platforms. Advances, particularly in mobile devices, have given birth to social networks and group gaming', 'Although the nature of gaming does not require physical stamina and therefore is not limited by factors such as age, gender, or fitness, it is most popular with adolescents. In 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified gaming disorder in their International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11). The ICD-11 is a list of diseases and medical conditions that aids health professionals in making diagnoses and treatment plans for patients having various disorders. It should be noted that, the inclusion of gaming disorder in the ICD-11 by WHO has generated vigorous and sometimes contentious debate and discussion within the medical and mental health community. Although recognized as an area of clinical interest, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) published by the American Psychiatric Association suggests that more clinical research is required before Gaming Disorder is formally considered as a psychiatric disorder. Similarly, the WHO notes the inclusion of gaming disorder in ICD-11, to encourage more research into excessive gaming behavior, including its prevention and treatment.', 'What is Online gaming disorder?', '2018 WHO draft 11th Revision of the ICD-11 denotes the disorder as a pattern of “digital-gaming” or “video-gaming” behavior characterized by impaired control over gaming activity, increasing priority given to gaming over other activities to the extent that gaming takes precedence over other interests and daily activities, and the continuation or escalation of gaming despite the occurrence of negative consequences.', 'Online Gaming disorder has the same similarities with Internet gaming disorder (IGD), which is a condition that the American Psychiatric Association (APA) noted in DSM-5 as an area in need of additional study. The APA does not currently recognize IGD as an official condition. For gaming disorder to be diagnosed, the WHO criteria require that the behavioral pattern of the gamer must be of sufficient severity that major and noticeable impairment and deterioration in personal, family, social, educational, occupational or other important areas of functioning is present for a minimum of 12 months.', 'Signs and symptoms of Online gaming disorder', 'According to the WHO definition, a person with online gaming disorder will demonstrate the following characteristics for at least 12 months; problems controlling control their gaming habits, seeing gaming as more important over other necessities and daily activities or work, continuing to engage in gaming even after its negative health and social problems has been identified or are evident. Further research shows that gaming disorders can also be linked to anxiety, depression, obesity, sleeping disorders, and stress. People who remain physically inactive for long periods because of gaming may also be at higher risk of obesity, sleep disorders, and other health-related issues, according to WHO [1].', 'Health consequences of video Online gaming', 'Video game-related health problems can cause continuous strain injuries, skin disorders, and other health issues. Other problems according to Shoja et al. (2007), include a condition that could be termed video game-provoked seizures in patients with pre-existing epilepsy. The following health consequences of video gaming have been reported.', 'Vision issues', 'Video game playing is associated with eye problems. Extensive and fixed staring at a video game screen causes eyestrain because the cornea, pupil, and iris are not biologically equipped for chronic heavy viewing of digital images from electronic devices. The visual system strain from frequent video game use over extended periods may result in headaches, dizziness, and in some cases, nausea and vomiting. Interestingly, there is some research that shows that gamers have an enhancement of spatial distribution of attention, compared with non-gamers. This somewhat predictable practice effect occurs with both peripheral and central visual attention. For sufferers of amblyopia (dimness or blurring of the eyesight due to a fault in transmission from the eye to the brain) video games may be helpful.', 'Musculoskeletal problems', 'Persistent gamers may also suffer from musculoskeletal problems. A survey of children indicated increased physical complaints associated with video game playing. Such complaints range from pain in the hands and wrists to back and neck. Furthermore, a case report involving a nine-year-old teenager referenced Playstation thumb. Playstation thumb is, characterized by numbness and a blister is caused by friction between the thumb and the controller from rapid and persistent gameplay. Using dermoscopy, dermatologists discovered hemorrhages and onycholysis (the loosening or separation of a fingernail) in a patient who presented with hyperkeratosis. Also, tendon injuries (tendinosis) of the hands and wrists from tendon overuse, is another health problem associated with video game playing. Furthermore, another case report in the New England Journal of Medicine reported a fracture of the base of the fifth metatarsal from people who play Wii video games. This condition has been termed (perhaps sarcastically), a Wii fracture. There are also postural problems associated with the persistent playing of video games, although, ergonomic measures (including chair to monitor position) could potentially improve postural problems associated with video game playing.', 'Obesity and overweight', 'Playing video games consistently has been associated with obesity. This is maybe related to the lack of physical activity in players. Alternatively, it could be that those who are less physically fit because of obesity gravitate towards less physically demanding activities, such as gaming. In either case, several studies have linked television and video games and increased Body Mass Index (BMI). It has been estimated that children in the United States spend 25% of their waking hours watching either television or playing video games. Furthermore, children who watch the most hours of television or play video games have the highest incidence of obesity. If video games are replacing physical activities and young people do not participate in physical recreation or see playing of video games as a form of recreation, this may be part of the link between times spent while playing video games and a rise in BMI in teenagers. Evidence for this potential link gains some support from a German study reporting that boys who spend no more than 1.5 hours per day engaged in television watching or playing video games, were 75.4% less likely to be overweight than those who spend more than 1.5 hours engaged in the same activity.', 'In a 2011 study, an association between video game activity and an increase of (mostly junk) food intake was reported. Specifically, single video game sessions caused an increase in food intake, regardless of appetite. It has also been suggested that active video game play using two popular gaming platforms has the opposite effect. Other researchers found no evidence that more active video games would result in a beneficial outcome although the study did demonstrate an increase in the amount of physical activity within the children receiving the active video games.', 'Seizures (Epileptic)', 'Health concerns ', 'that video games', ' may cause epileptic seizures started in the early 1980s. The first medically documented case of a video game-induced seizure was reported in 1981. In 1993, a story in the popular press (Sun newspaper) reported that a boy choked to death on his own vomit during a seizure triggered by playing a video game. Similar but less serious incidents were subsequently reported by news media around the world, ultimately motivating video game console manufacturers to include that epilepsy warnings in the instruction manuals for their gaming products. In 1994 it was reported that video games only cause seizures in people already predisposed to epilepsy and advised that people with a predisposition to epilepsy can greatly reduce the risk of a seizure by staying 10 feet or more away from the TV set and wearing sunglasses while playing video games. This is clearly an area in need of additional research.', 'Prevention and treatment of online gaming disorder', 'The cost: benefit value of prevention versus treatment of addiction disorders has been known for many years. It is important and beneficial to make use of several types of strategies in combating gaming addictiveness or disorder. Effective strategies include: educating gamers about gaming behaviors and consequences on their mental health; treatment geared towards helping the gamer to control his/her urge for video games, recognizing and dealing with disturbing thoughts and learning how to cope without video games; intrapersonal and interpersonal counseling to help gamers to explore their identity, build self-esteem, and enhance their emotional intelligence outside the fictional world of gaming and learning communication and assertiveness skills needed in social interactions; family involvement, including counseling and discussion family and other relationships; and developing new lifestyles. The latter is particularly important and to paraphrase the well-known mantra of Alcoholics Anonymous, it’s all about, people, places, and things. To prevent the persistent playing of video games, people need to explore new activities, set new goals and metrics of achievements beyond video game scores.'])\n",

The impact of it on Jobs and Services is going to be long-lasting and it will be the foundation stone of revolution in these sectors. With the work from home and social distancing norms is altering the way of work, the way we interact, what work we will do, how the work will be done, and whatnot. To just give an example, in the middle of the first lockdown, FMCG major Hindustan Unilever (HUL) went ahead with its merger. It took place online entirely. Yes, it took place online. Who could have ever imagined the merger can take place online?', 'Change is inevitable. But some changes are temporary and some are permanent. The pandemic is bringing changes that are going to be permanent. In fact, these changes were due for a long time and we’re coming at a slow pace. What the pandemic has done is, it has become the catalyst for these changes and raised the ante for change. So, what exactly the changes will be? Let’s look at them one by one.', 'The first change is going to be the extensive use of digital communication from now onwards. The Zoom, Jio Meet, Google Meet, and some derivatives like these are going to be the forever meeting rooms where the important discussions will be held. This may be bad news for the employees who are older than 40 years. They would not have pictured themselves doing such transformation at this part of life. Experts believe that the new normal in the offices are going to be hierarchy-less. The older employees would have to work with the younger ones. There would be no geographical boundaries and where the communication and software adaptability among employees is going to be crucial. The symbol of power will be less visible and the decentralization of power in the office will be prominent. There will be more egalitarianism in companies. The corporates will think much more about office space. Rather than expending too much on physical infrastructure, the online infrastructure will always be in their hindsight. The impact would be more prudent in small and mid-sized businesses. The physical offices itself might disappear from such businesses. But it’s not going to be easy for companies. The security and confidentiality of the authentic information going out of the offices’ building are going to be the largest concern in the new normal world. There would be no surprise if a lot of start-ups will bloom in the near future providing software for security for the data and information of the companies. Also, travel is going to be reduced. So, the major component of CTC where the companies fooling the employees must find the other way.', 'The second change is going to be struck down on employees. Already many of the companies and start-ups are reducing the workforce. It is expected that new normal offices would work with an 80% workforce of that of the current workforce. Automation is on the verge. Due to safety reasons, the companies are going to be more and more leaned towards automation with a minimal touch of human possible. This might result in a loss of jobs in some sectors, but it will also create new jobs in the automation sector. It was evident from before pandemic too but now the velocity for the same would be increased. In the new normal tech-enabled world, the job which would be at stake dominantly would be managers’ managers. The IT firms have started firing the vice presidents and assistant vice presidents who draw hefty salaries but don’t really drive the business. In the designation-less set up in the near future accelerated by Pandemic, they automatically become redundant. For the first time, the employees might be given jobs that would require more than the standard jobs. Also, when the workforce in the company would be less in the company, the employees might be given the option of working for extra time or working on the weekends and would be incentivized for the same rather than employing more staff and paying them full salary. It is a win-win situation for both employees and companies. Employees can earn more than what they usually earn and will get to learn new which would be out of their primary domain. The companies would be able to keep their costs low through this. The assessment of employees might change too. Rather than going for an annual performance review, the employees might be evaluated based on the tasks they perform. Creativity and innovation are going to be swords for the employees in the new normal world rather than designations in the office. \\xa0', 'The other change might be in the services sector. The services like which involves maximum human touch will be the one which will be affected most adversely. The safety concerns and confidence of people over the system are going to be the issue for at least the next few years. It also opens the opportunity for something very new. The products which could replace the need for visiting such services centers are going to create a boom in the market. According to McKinsey, the sales for such products are multiplying rapidly.', 'There are speculations that the economies will tend to become Minimalist economies. Let’s dig deep into this. Minimalist economies are the economies where people tend to refrain from purchasing luxurious items and focuses on purchasing necessities more and more.\\xa0 Well, this is the position we are in right now during the pandemic. People are expensing only necessary items like groceries and the demand for luxurious items is way below average. But it would be hard to stay the same as this. The minimalist economy will result in the deterioration of the economy in the short term. It is true that in the minimalist economy the demand might be low, but it would be wrong to assume the demand will be zero. The high-quality products will gather the attention of the purchasers. It is evident from past experiences that the economy always finds its way to come back from the mode of minimalist economy. Though this time may take some time, it will surely return on track.', 'But every trouble comes with an opportunity. This is the time for the companies to act now and grab the opportunities the pandemic has brought with him. But for that companies are required to follow plans, formulate strategies to suit their needs, and pay more attention to the innovation. The companies must form plans for the five stages from here.

The tendency of the company should not be like that, they will return only after everything becomes normal. In most parts of the country, permission is granted to the companies for their operations. If they wait for normalcy, then bankruptcy might catch them before the normalcy.', 'Resilience: ', 'The resilience phase includes maintaining liquidity, addressing solvency, and grow for sustainability. All businesses should know when their cash crunch is coming. Addressing these cash crunches will be crucial for the companies. Businesses must take aggressive options to remain solvent. For example, the businesses might have cash in their hand but might be poor in operational efficiency then it requires the attention of the company. Organizations solving issues of liquidity and solvency will be in a better position to grow with sustainability.', 'Return: ', 'In the third phase of return the companies will have to plan for the time when everything will be back on track. Given the possibility of subsequent waves of coronavirus the companies need new ways of working to prevent, identify, report, and contain future flareups. Many industries will face this problem of returning. Staying prepared for resurgence scenarios should include a multi-scenario modeling exercise. Reverting to non-COVID-19 care will require extensive planning and market testing.', 'Reimagine: ', 'The phase of reimagining will include the learnings from the pandemic. A small virus and the whole economy at the toss. The businesses will have to introspect them and must look for advancements in technologies such that this kind of pandemic in the future will not disturb their efficiency too much. The pandemic has taught us that the decision which took weeks and months in the normal world can be accelerated and can be taken in some days. This should become a permanent feature. Cross organizational collaboration has become much easier. This should stay in the long run.', 'Reform: ', 'The last phase is the reform. In this phase, the companies should look at their bottlenecks and try to fix them. Also, the companies will have to reconsider their relationship with their customers. The confidence in their brands, they must regain it.', 'There are three ways to shift work, talent, and skills to where and when they are needed most, thereby building the organizational resilience and agility necessary to navigate uncertain times and rebound with strength when the economy recovers.', 'Make work portable:', 'In this dismal situation it is more important than ever most of the staff should be in the critical tasks. The tasks could be like the customer complaints redressal. We know that the customers are the ones who make the businesses successful. Thus, retaining their confidence is the utmost priority. The organizations can convert some of the staff to address the queries and concerns of customers. The organizations require to create virtual offices. There should not be the geographical boundaries within the organization. The employees from all over the world from the organization should come together and take the organization back to pre-corvid state. By breaking out of rigid job constraints, the right talent and work can be matched to solve evolving business challenges in real-time.', 'Accelerate Automation:', 'This was happening before the pandemic too. But accelerating it with pace has now become the need of the hour. The perception that automation is a job-killer is totally wrong and in fact, it is the mandatory capability to deal with the crisis. Organizations can increase automation in call centers. This will reduce the response time.', 'Share employees in cross-industry exchanges:', 'Temporarily moving employees from some industries like airlines, restaurants, hospitality can be moved to those organizations which have maximum work at this time like healthcare and logistics.', 'To conclude, the companies should understand “Lives come first, but livelihood matters”. The pandemic will have some adverse effects on jobs and services, but this is not the end. The pandemic has brought many opportunities with him and if they are grabbed then the organizations would be in much better position even compared to pre-corvid situations. The companies need to understand the pandemic is not going to be forever. The last concluding sentence will be corona will bring changes but there will not be a revolution in jobs and services.'])\n",

The importance of street food vendors not only helps in increasing the country’s per capita income but also helps to make a living for the unemployed in society with a limited investment. Most of them are the sole breadwinners for their families. So, with the Covid-19 wreaking havoc, the uncertainty of the lockdown policies increased the concern of people over hygiene and the lack of investment to upgrade their businesses to provide better hygiene facilities that can take away food from their mouths.', '\\xa0Various states have provided relief packages and support but, in a country, as populous as ours, it has hardly been appropriately implemented. Delhi, for instance, recently announced a rupee 500 million stimulus package to nearly 500,000 rupees, recognizing the severe consequences of the loss of livelihoods. The seller’s intended remedy is a credit loan that provides all sellers with an initial working capital of Rs 10,000, but this is not enough. Instead of loans, the government should consider converting them directly into income benefits, cash subsidies to secure a livelihood in order to initiate income-generating activities on a regular basis. Sellers need income support to get back to work, and if they can’t, they will never be able to repay the loan amount.

We have fire extinguishers in buildings, but barely any knowledge of how to use it. We convince ourselves that we are prepared but in the face of adversity we stand dumbfounded and give the simplest excuse, that of being in ‘unprecedented times’. The same thing has happened with the coronavirus crisis. If we look back, we can see that this crisis was not avoidable. There was a lot we could have done, but because we underestimated it so much, the situation has now blown out of proportion and cost us thousands of lives, millions of jobs and a massive hit to the world economy. We may be in a unique condition but there is still a lot that we can apply from past experiences and previous calamities.\\xa0', 'First, let’s look at this in a reflective mode. What are the things we could have done to avoid this crisis in the first place? Controlling the origin of a virus is difficult but preventing it from spreading is not. One of the biggest contributors to this unforgiving crisis is the lack of communication or even worse, the propagation of fake news. Take India for example. Clear communication about the virus was only initiated after a few cases had been identified. We were aware of the hazards of this virus since before and should have acted sooner. The spread of accurate and timely information is a must. If we had spread awareness earlier, we could have controlled the number of cases better, like New Zealand and Ireland have done. Secondly, in a situation of crisis, the first thing to spread is fake news. It is imperative that the government, social media agencies and people themselves act more responsibly. Since there is no accurate and transparent information, a lot of uncertainty exists in the society. This impacts the confidence of consumers and investors in the market, which in turn leads to an economic slowdown. Past experiences with financial breakdowns and recessions have shown us that retain market trust can only occur with transparency and accuracy of information. Organisations should have acted earlier and communicated more effectively with their employees.\\xa0', 'Moreover, we must also understand that specific sectors take the hardest hit during lockdowns. As we have witnessed in earlier lockdowns, curfews, national emergencies and pandemics, the first segment of society to take a hit is the daily wagers and labourers. Not only do the prices of goods increase but their income also takes a decline in such a crisis. In such situations, they can’t even afford basic amenities. India witnessed a mass exodus recently, with thousands of people trying to return to their villages on foot. This only leads to more chaos and a decline in containment of the disease. The government should have accounted for such factors before announcing a lockdown with a four hour notice. They could have made better arrangements for food and water in the metro cities itself or giving them safer means to travel home.\\xa0This is something that they can still include in their relief programs.', 'Government intervention is a must right now. This can be done in two ways. First, is to create more employment opportunities. Governments used this strategy in the SARS and Ebola Virus emergency. Health, water, sanitation and hygiene are the most services in the times of health emergencies. Intense investment for these services and infrastructure can provide immediate jobs. Secondly, if governments use fiscal and monetary policy to fuel demand and maintain current living standards, it can decrease the propensity of a huge fall in economic growth. ', 'A fiscal stimulus by the government', ' can make all the difference. Having better avenues for cash transfers, easier loans and more exchange will automatically help. A fall in the growth rate is unavoidable as lots of sectors have no choice but to pause all work. However, ', 'industries that can provide high returns', ' even now must be encouraged. For example, IT sector, health, food and agriculture, etc.', 'Moreover, governments and businesses should use the most important tool in their hand, the internet! Even in the times of physical social distancing, we are still connected to people across the world and are socialising at our normal rates. Governments should use these mediums to maintain public spirit, communicate policy strategies and inform people. Businesses should use these means to continue working and maintain employee morale. To have balanced crisis management and to prevent panic in the masses, social dialogue and engagement at every level is imperative. Use these mediums to educate people about the importance of social distancing, hygiene and steps to be followed.', 'All diseases are different and the scientific approach to tackle them varies. However, with most epidemics and pandemics some common steps can be followed. Our past experience with fast spreading diseases has shown that the easiest and most effective way to curb it is social distancing. Countries have taken impressive steps to ensure social distancing and must keep this up for even a few weeks after curbing the disease. Maintaining sanitary habits and hygiene can protect us from infections and increase our immunity. While governments and medical agencies look for ways to tackle the virus at a macro level, we must continue to follow all measures on an individual level too.', 'We must also pay a lot of attention to mental and physical well-being now. In the past, when economies took a hit due to the 2008 recession or calamities, the first thing to break was people’s self-esteem. Suicide rates, amount of domestic abuse and cases of depression increased manifold. We have to take effort and ensure that we try and live as much of a balanced life as possible. We should stay connected to our friends and not be ashamed of reaching out to others for help. Social distancing is not easy and can take a toll on many. Lots of special helplines have been set up for the same and people must use them if needed. Governments have also given code words for victims of domestic abuse to report crimes in countries like France and Spain. We must remember to stay mentally healthy and calm during a crisis as that is the most important thing.', 'I don’t believe that every crisis is the same. Of course, there are a lot of unique things about the coronavirus pandemic that we had not expected to ever see. Even though these are different times, there are still lots of things we can apply from our past experiences. We cannot find a cure for the virus but we can find ways to maintain the economy, our mental peace, and prevent the spread of the virus. The past has a lot to offer if we ponder. We must learn to understand the mistakes of the past and better them in the future. Our past experiences with the different crises have taught us that fiscal stimuli work, maintaining employee morale is important and that social. Engagement is imperative. If we use these tools efficiently, we can ensure that people only have to fight the virus and not worry about the multitude of repercussions that come with it.'])\n",

Supply chain management is an important area with many opportunities for our community to contribute in various forms. \\xa0According to the data produced by Supply Management’s Report on Business show that PMI (Purchasing Manager’s Index) has declined 1% in the month of February. Mainly there has been a huge contraction in the Petroleum, Transportation and Textile Industries. Although there has been a fall in the inventory but is expected to grow due to supply chain disruptions leading to inefficiencies in material conversion and continued advanced stocking to protect production schedules. A analysis by trading platform Forex claimed that heavily 75% of all companies had already reported supply chain disruptions with more than 80% believing that at some point they would experience impacts as a result of Covid-19 disruptions. The effective shutdown of industrial activity i.e. China, ground zero for the virus presented particularly difficult problems for manufacturing firms worldwide. Imported goods invested by investors set a significant setback.', 'Several experiments were carried out by different governments across the globe to restrict the spread of this pandemic. Boris Johnson introduced the herd immunity plan in the United Kingdom which was a failure followed by a mitigate model which India also tried initially to stop the spread of the Covid-19 virus. The last and the ultimate model that most of the countries are applying is the Hammer and the Dance Model i.e. the Lockdown Model which is estimated to bring down the caseload by 25-30%. The Lockdown model basically means buying time to prepare the vaccine to kill the virus.', 'However, the lockdown has certain critical economic consequences which add to the burden of global distress. This can be explained using the standard macroeconomic Keynesian model. The lockdown and the spread of the disease have a direct negative shock on aggregate consumption levels and exports. This leads to a contraction in aggregate demand which leads to a fall in the market rate of interest and aggregate equilibrium output. The secondary effect on the commodity market is via investment demand function which can either increase owing to a fall in the market rate of interest, or fall owing to the contraction in aggregate demand. Clearly, the contraction of the Aggregate Demand-side generates an economic slowdown. On the other hand, restriction of workers gathering in the workplace owing to lockdown hurts the production in those sectors which need the presence of physical workers. Note that software or financial service-producing sectors are exempted from such negative supply shock at least in the short-run to medium-run since those works could be easily carried out based on “work from home” anthem. However, reverse migration of workers is an indication of a sharp cut down in production activities. This Aggregate supply shock leads to the situation of stagflation. In recent announcements by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to ease liquidity in the system may prove to be counterproductive provided the aggregate supply shock, since the escalation of demand specifically for non-traded products without an adequate increase in production (supply) would only result in inflation. In other words, supply-side management must go hand in hand with demand-side policies. Even if policies are undertaken at the national level by the government, however, conditions may not improve much due to shocks in the external sector through trade in commodities. Most imports are banned which will increase the economic cost of production of import substitutes within the domestic territory based on the theory of comparative advantage in a Ricardian sense. At the same time, exports are hurt due to lower demand from the developed economies. This shows that unemployment and inflation are inevitable in the near future.', 'Corona Virus has mainly affected raw material export-driven countries. With the Covid-19 virus in the backdrop there will be a decline in new orders, production, and employment with ease in supplier deliveries as demand will be less with a mild decline in the inventories. There has been a huge revenue impact. Long stretches of empty supermarket shelves and shortage of essential commodities are only the visible impacts to consumers of the global chain disruption caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The uncertainties ahead swing between extremes. As the shortages worsen before they get resolved prices of many commodities could go up for consumers even if laws exist against price gouging. At the same time we should keep in mind that constrained supplies could cause a decline in demand which in turn may end up weakening prices. Risk Management process is not robust enough to cope with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. The seemingly relentless forces of globalization and technology with coronavirus in the backdrop will present us with new supply chain challenges and opportunities for further progress in the near future. There is a glimmer of good news as countries globally haven taken preventive measures but the recovery may be fragile.', 'The crisis due to the global pandemic is likely to be more serious for developing economies compared to the global financial crisis of 2008. This is due to the fact that the global financial crisis leads to lower demand for exports from the developing economies by the developed nations which further lead to contraction of export-based industries and other sectors in the developing nations due to inter-sectoral backward and forward linkage effect, however, the burden of retrenchments in the formal sector was absorbed in the informal sector. In the present situation, the problem of vanishing informal sector is evident since informal sector workers are more vulnerable to the spread of the disease due to the absence of non-regulatory authority and out of direct government control. Moreover, lockdown lead to massive close down of this informal units, thus the informal sector in this present set up is vanishing due to which the shock absorption capacity of developing economy like India is becoming weaker. The global economy is drowning towards deep cycles of economic depression and the aftershocks seem to be long-lasting. The only way of this global shock seems to be international policy coordination in line with the needs of the domestic economies'])\n",

Well, it is quite obvious that offices will start functioning now, but, the COVID period hasn’t ended. This means that social distancing will also have to be followed in offices; where it will be a problem to do so because of the lack of adequate infrastructure and space. The same will be the condition in co-working industries, wherein employees of different companies come and work together under the same roof.', 'However, these problems are quite obvious (though people haven’t thought about them much), but the fact which people fail to notice and understand is that the meaning of space is not only limited to infrastructural space which is measured in square foot or square meters; but it also extends to metal space, or for that fact, space in the minds of people for others and their thoughts as well as opinions.', 'Coronavirus has left a big scratch in our country; just the way a car needs repair after an accident, our country will also need repair after the control of this virus. But, unlike a car, our country will require a large amount of time to get restored and to stand straight without any support.', 'Needless to say, the economic stability of our country will definitely be hit because of this reason. But the problem is since the earnings of the employers will reduce, it will subsequently lead to a drop in the salary of the employees. While some employees might be preferred by their bosses and may receive a raise regularly, others might be subjected to unfair treatment and made to do the same amount of work for a lower salary.', 'People tend to overlook the thin line which exists between cooperation and competition. The problem doesn’t arise when such a situation happens wherein an employee is getting paid more than the other, but instead, it arises when people start to compare their earnings as well as benefits to that of others. And in today’s world, where people keep money at the top of their priority list, comparisons will play a very important role in the performance of employees and their company.', 'Since there will exist inequalities and partialities in companies, there will also exist a sense of hatred and competition among the employees of the same company; who will compete to get a better position or a raise in their salary. This may seem beneficial to some as it might compel the employees to work harder and better, but however, will bring huge losses in the long run. The fact is; employees might end up doing unethical acts which will help them to make a better impression in their boss’s eyes.', 'Moreover, since there will be comparisons among the employees, it might happen that the ‘Employee of the Month’ ends up being hated by all other employees in the company. Another situation that might arise is that of bluffing and pretending; wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they don’t. This might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around, and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office. In fact, employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities; which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their best.', 'Such situations will definitely arise in companies and offices; wherein employees will compete for attention and resources; which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning. And all this will happen because of only one thing; lack of office mental space i.e. space in the minds of people working together in a particular office for cooperation and teamwork, along with ignorance of the fact that things will get better and eventually the same after some time.', 'Another kind of industry and companies that will be affected due to the long-lasting impact of COVID 19 is the co-working industry and offices. This is because, there will be a shortage of resources and the income of people, but the maintenance cost to be born for the infrastructure, as well the rent will remain the same. Because of this, employees will be told by the company owners to exploit the resources present in the offices and use them to the fullest; to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used. However, the number of resources will be the same, and so, there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same.', 'If the above two situations happen to occur at the same time (which they most likely will), we will observe a scene of intra-company as well as inter-company competition. Also, our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition; which itself will be a result of limited mental space.', 'COVID 19 will have severe impacts on the office (mental) space of companies and people.\\xa0 People’s thoughts, how they treat others, along with accepting defeat and rejection will be an important aspect of everyone’s lives. Moreover, we might also observe a shoot in the intensity and frequency of office people going to psychologists; because of repeated rejection and unfair treatment.

The situation we are in also brings new business models and opportunities, in defining, for instance, new delivery concepts, human capital sharing platforms, initiatives in promoting the “staycation or holiday concept” and the use of the less productive time to work on activities that were normally pushed forward like asset counts, security plans, defining standard operating procedures, social media plans, etc.', 'WHAT HAS CAUSED THE PANIC?', 'This may seem obvious, but it’s worth looking at this a bit closer. The main reason there was such widespread panic was that the government announced its advice to avoid public meeting places like restaurants, bars, and pubs without simultaneously announcing a complete ban or a plan to support the businesses whose revenue streams they’d just denied. Many of these businesses operate on low margins and very fragile cash flow already so the prospect of survival for an indefinite period of time without income seemed very bleak indeed. This has taken a mental toll on already stressed business owners and their worried staff.', 'FACTS & FIGURES – Coronavirus Effect on the Hospitality:', 'The', ' impact of the novel coronavirus', ' on India’s hospitality sector jobs is nothing short of severe. While most economists expect things to rebound in the latter half of the year, uncertainty still lurks. A sheer job trauma is staring at the hospitality industry in the near future. This is as the chances of losing a job are at high risk. Furthermore the entry-level has postponed the hiring for the near future. Let us check here some of the facts concerning the drop in the various hotel occupancy sectors.', 'The country’s daily hotel occupancy dropped to 11% during 23-29 March, according to preliminary data from STR, Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, Government of India due to COVID-19 concerns, and limitations that have intensified in India.', 'Along with a steep downward trend in occupancy, the average daily rate (ADR), and revenue per available room (RevPAR) have also dropped significantly in India. ADR, which has dropped year over year by around 20% or more for eight consecutive days, went as low as INR4, 924.18 on 28 March. RevPAR attained its least absolute level (INR537.54) on 22 March.', 'In India, both luxury and budget hotels are running at just 10 percent of occupancy levels as thousands of people have canceled their trips. This may further worsen in the times to come at least till the end of this year. For instance, Airbnb announced its guests could cancel their reservations for a full refund.', 'The overall revenue of the Indian hotel sector is set to decline by anywhere between US$ 8.85 billion to US$ 10 billion, reflecting an erosion of 39% to 45% compared to last year.', 'Besides the actual business loss, the hotel owners will also incur losses due to fixed operating expenses, debt repayments, interest payments, and several other compliances required to be undertaken as part of the sector.', 'With\\xa0hospitality and trave', 'l', '\\xa0sectors among the worst affected by COVID-19, OYO’s entire executive leadership (CXOs) team has taken a voluntary pay cut, starting at 25%, with many opting for a supplementary untapped amount, and some going up to 50% to enable constructing the runway for the company.', 'Ritesh Agarwal, the Founder & Group CEO, OYO Hotels & Homes, has decided to forego 100% of his salary for the rest of the year in the wake of the novel coronavirus crisis.', 'Proposed Action Plans -Coronavirus Effect on the Hospitality', 'The hospitality industry can use this chasm to prepare for the upcoming demand by focusing on marketing and up-gradation. This ‘Stop Gap Plan’ is about maintaining a thread of communication, using social media and advertisements, with the consumers. It’s also about strengthening the communication within the company, making a budget and plan for re-opening, and utilizing this period to fix and upgrade whatever is possible. Another step is where all the action is required by the sector. Once the outbreak of the virus is contained and the world is set to travel again, it is suggested that any plan of re-opening must be done keeping long-term benefits and safety compliances in mind. It is imperative that hospitality companies reach out to deferred and canceled bookings and give due attention to domestic travelers. The hotels and airlines must slowly roll out their services rather than starting everything instantly and not get caught up in spending.This way Coronavirus Effect on the Hospitality', 'A Way Forward: Recommendations for the Government of India', 'The government is already taking measures to combat the effects of the pandemic on the country. Here are the multiple measures, if taken by the government of India, can help the Indian hotel industry weather the current storm.', 'Stimulus package to stabilize and support the hospitality sector in the near term, including a workforce support fund to ensure that there are no job losses.', 'Provide a moratorium of ~ 6 – 12 months on all loans (principal & interest), including working capital payments and overdrafts.', 'Ensure that credit rating agencies do not downgrade ratings of businesses, due to the expected volatility of the business in the short to medium term.', '\\n', 'Provide a 12-month corporate tax holiday to travel, tourism, and hospitality sectors.', '\\n', 'Defer all statutory dues such as advance tax, custom duties, excise duties, PF, bank charges, etc. at the central and state level for 12 months.', '\\n', 'The government authorities must ensure that there is adequate availability of collateral-free and interest-free credit for organizations in the hospitality,\\xa0travel, and tourism\\xa0industries.', '\\n', '\\n', 'WHAT WILL CORONAVIRUS LEAVE BEHIND?', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', '\\n', 'Really this is anyone’s guess.

With proper support from the government I think the hospitality industry stands a good chance of bouncing back quickly, but perhaps not in its former form. It is likely that we will see a kind of natural selection take place among restaurants, leaving space for innovative new entrants. The crisis has already forced several restaurants to innovate by developing new services and perhaps, if regulation allows, these will stick, becoming new models for restaurants in the future and offering them a more diverse and resilient set of revenue streams.

The crisis has already led to a ', 'worldwide economic slowdown and a period of recession', ' is looming on our heads. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted a shrink of ', '3%', ' in the ', 'Global GDP', ' indicating the extent of the crisis. The severity of the issue is being felt by various big companies in India and other major powers of the world. In an interview, Anand Mahindra, CEO of M&M Group said that the ', 'manufacturing and production sector', ' has been hit the hardest with the ', 'lack of labor force', '. He mentioned the lack of wage workers who help in loading and unloading of material is making transport a major issue for his company, also hinting at the importance of these small workers on the macro-level. CEOs and Managers of various organizations are having a hard time dealing with this crisis. With almost all MNCs such as PwC, BCG, Deloitte, IBM, Infosys, etc. making “work from home” compulsory till around mid-May’20, the ', 'importance of technology', ' is at its peak now. Whether it’s ', 'conducting meetings over Zoom or conference calls over Duo', ', staying at home and working is becoming normal as we move forward.

According to the IMF the world is going to lose ', 'USD 9 Trillion in output in 2020', ' which is more than the combined output of both Germany and Japan.', 'The ', 'manufacturing sector', ' is one of the worst-hit by the pandemic. China, the world’s largest exporter of goods and the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic has seen a significant fall in output in the first two months of 2020.

Restrictions have affected the supply of Chinese companies like JCB, SAIC, Nissan to name a few. Organizations such as Samsung, Kia, Hyundai, and all other non-essential goods companies have been forced to shut down factories to comply with lockdown norms and for the safety of their employees. Indian manufacturing giants such as Bajaj and Tata have taken the toll due to the lockdown measures in India. Bajaj has been forced to cut employee salaries by 30% and worker salaries by 10% due to a lack of revenue. US-based smartphone and tech giant Apple Inc. has shut all its stores worldwide with its factories in China and the USA unable to produce new products for the time being. These are just a few examples and production has been hit globally in all countries and there is a lack of demand to compliment this, further enhancing the problem faced by producers.', 'The world of work also includes those who are willing and able to work but cannot find a job, i.e., the unemployed.

The financial crisis of 2008 caused a 22 million spike in unemployment worldwide and the nature of the current situation makes it more dangerous. The fall in revenues and effects on both supply as well as demand mean that companies are having a hard time maintaining their balance sheet and taking care of their liabilities. Lack of job opportunities from the next quarter and salary cuts for existing employees might be the way forward in the corporate world.', 'Amongst all the negative impacts of COVID-19 on organizations across the globe, there are a few opportunities that are ready to be explored after this crisis. ', 'Technology and Artificial Intelligence', ' are key aspects that have been mentioned in the past to be the ones contributing to the growth and a rise in revenues for various businesses. In times of Social Distancing and a shutdown of physical services, the digital markets may prove to be game-changers in the near future. Offering products online and promoting through digital marketing will be at the forefront. The quarantine time must be utilized in order to improve existing products and increase the customer base of companies. Byju’s, India’s famous online learning platform is leading by example in this front by offering its application essentials and courses for free. This will help them expand their brand in the coming years and create a customer base. Cult Fit, a Bangalore based fitness startup has used technology to create an application helping fitness freaks to workout from home. ONEPLUS, the Chinese Smartphone brand launched its new flagship, the ONEPLUS 8 in an online event, and created a filter to let smartphone lovers do a virtual unboxing of the device as getting the device physically is not possible at the moment due to restrictions. ', 'Decathlon', ', America’s leading sports and fitness equipment brand started an online campaign, “We’re in this Together” and the hashtag “#PlayItSafe” to appeal to their customers and increase sales of their home workout equipment.

The ', 'Service sector', ' will need to move to ', 'digital platforms', ' and ', 'hype digital marketing', '. Artificial intelligence will play a key role with a reduction in workforce eminent due to lack of demand. Handling tasks with the help of AI and reducing the need for an employee will improve cost-effectiveness until revenues rise back to normal. E-Learning has evolved over the past few years and its importance has been realized over this quarantine period. All major colleges and schools have transformed into an online program in order to educate students. This change is likely to be carried forward with more and more Educational Institutes switching platforms. E-commerce has also been an integral part of the world and will become even more important in the coming days. As malls and markets are shut and are expected to remain shut, e-commerce websites will benefit from the same. It is also an opportunity for retailers and vendors to create their base online or sell through e-retailers in order to generate revenue. Small vendors and retailers will continue to be an important part of the supply of the essential good to households and improving sanitation in these places will be key. ', 'MNCs ', 'that have switched to the atmosphere of “Work from Home” will find it easier to connect large groups of people together at all times and ensure all employees contribute to the smooth functioning of the companies in the crucial days up ahead.

As employees continue to work from home and make study rooms their cabins, organizations need to adapt to this new style of working and realize its importance for the coming months until a solution is found for this problem.

The global COVID-19 pandemic has caused never-seen-before disruption in both public and economic life. Not only have factories shut down or supply chains abruptly stopped or millions of workers stranded, but festivals suspended, families separated across countries and public-healthcare systems put under tremendous stress. Such a scenario is a first-time for many, but the world has been through pandemics of a similar scale and nature before, and after the due struggle, emerged victoriously. As the more experienced amongst us would remember, the SARS and MERS outbreaks in the early 2000s presented a similar scenario, although at a much lower rate of infection, yet with higher rates of morbidity. Going back further in time, the 1918 Spanish Flu brought a world just out of the first world war, to a standstill. Considered to be the worst amongst modern-era pandemics, the Influenza pandemic affected one-third of the world’s population and 50 million lives. Yet, preventive measures such as social-distancing, quarantine, mass-vaccinations, public support, and restraint have proved to be successful in all such situations, even being effective in occasional plague outbreaks across the world.

The coronavirus outbreak happening in the world is no more just an epidemic but it is also considered as a global pandemic now. The people everywhere in the world are being asked to stay home and stay away from other people so as to reduce the risk of infection.', 'The deadly disease Coronavirus has brought with it a wave of negative outcomes, terrible illness, and death, but at the same time it has also highlighted some important life lessons. Some of them are as follows:', '1. ', 'You should be willing to trade some of ', 'your freedom for the greater good of the public: There is no doubt for anyone that it has been difficult for everyone in the world to stay at home. Many people complaining about feeling bored and aimless. Some people may even have the feeling that it is a breach of their individual rights, being made to stay home. However, when it comes to the greater good, one should always be willing to sacrifice a little bit of that freedom. A balance between individual rights and public safety is an ever-changing thing. Trade a little bit of your freedom for the greater good of the public.', '2. ', 'You should wash your hands, whether there’s a virus or not: ', 'General hygiene is always important. Not just when there is a virus. You should know the drill by now. Wet your hands. Lather them with soap. Scrub for 20 seconds. Rinse off. Dry with a clean towel.

Many people from all over the world are unable to get online, particularly the people who live in developing countries, and so they lack meaningful ways to influence the global players shaping their everyday lives.

', 'Learn to appreciate nature: ', 'If you live near a spacious outdoor area, like the desert or an empty road lined with trees and you realize it is the only safe, surface-less space to take a walk in, then you start to realize how beautiful nature actually is. The point is not to remain indoors, but to avoid being in close contact with others.

Every 4-5 years, Indian citizens hear about so many trillions of public money being misappropriated and eventually lost by people who the public is supposed to start. In this article, with examples, I would like to point out that there are two factors to scams like Nirav Modi: the complicity of actors within the financial industry and the systemic loopholes in an emerging financial system that has been used for scams like Nirav Modi.', 'The first financial scam of Independent India was found in 1958 when Feroze Gandhi, MP found that In 1957, Haridas Mundhra got the government-owned Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) to invest Rs. 12.4 million (about US$3.2 million at the time) in the shares of six troubled companies of whom Mundhra held a large number of shares which he was trying to boost by rigging the market. The investment was done under governmental pressure and bypassed the LIC’s investment committee, which was informed of this decision only after the deal had gone through. In the event, LIC lost most of the money. Several leading stockbrokers who were on the LIC Investment Committee testified that the investment could not have been made for the purpose of propping up the market, as was claimed by the Finance Ministry, and that had the LIC consulted the Investment Committee, they would have pointed out Mundhra’s forged shares episode from 1956. The Finance Minister T. T. Krishnamachari, in his testimony, tried to distance himself from the LIC decision, implying that it may have been taken by the Finance Secretary, but Justice M.C. Chagla held that the Minister is constitutionally responsible for the action taken by his secretary and he disowns his actions. Eventually, Krishanamachari had to resign. The Nehru government suffered considerable loss of prestige in the incident.', 'The 1992 Indian stock market scam was a stock market scam orchestrated by Harshad Mehta. The scam took place in Mumbai and was the biggest market scam of India. The 1992 scam was a systematic stock fraud using bank receipts and stamp paper which caused the Indian Stock market to crash. The scam lead to a complete structural change of the security system of India and introduced a completely new system of stock transactions. The 1992 scam exposed the Indian financial systems through the inherent loopholes of the system. This scam led to the reform of the security system of India and introduced online security systems. The scam was orchestrated in such a way that Mehta secured securities from the State Bank of India against forged cheques signed by corrupt officials and failed to deliver the securities. Mehta made the prices of the stocks soar high through fictitious practices and would go on to sell the stocks that he owned in these companies. The 1992 scam raises many questions which involved many bank officials responsible for collusion with Mehta. The 1992 scam caused an investigation through which many officials were implicated in fraudulent charges. The security system of India took a rapid reform in its fundamental structure post the 1992 scam. The first major structural change was the formation of the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE). The first major reform in the financial sector of India was the formation of the CII Code for Desirable Corporate Governance developed by Rahul Bajaj. Post-1992, a new regulatory board known as the Securities and Exchange Board of India was formed to monitor the National Stock Exchange and the National Securities Depository. There were structural changes in the equity market. The government introduced ten acts of parliament and one constitutional amendment based upon the principles of economic reform and legislative change for the equity market. The NSE introduced online trading in 1994 which changed the dynamics of stock buying and selling. The capital market now opened up nationally as opposed to being confined in Mumbai. The exchange system started functioning based on satellite communications that abolished geographical barriers.', 'In 2001, Ketan Parekh purchased large stakes in less known small market capitalization companies and jacked up their prices through circular trading with other traders, and collusion with these companies and large institutional investors.

This set of ten stocks was colloquially referred to as “K-10” stocks and Parekh was playfully referred to as “Pentafour”. The RBI commenced an investigation against Parekh. Around the same time, a bear cartel of brokers in Mumbai opposed to Parekh tried to dump their shares of K-10 stocks. Panicking, Parekh sold off his entire ownership of the so-called K-10 stocks that he had successfully jacked up over the past two years.

CBI arrested eight top-ranking officials of public sector banks and financial institutions, including the LIC Housing Finance CEO Ramchandran Nair, in connection with the scam. CBI alleged that the officers of various public sector banks and financial institutions received bribes from a private financial services company, which acted as a mediator for corporate loans and other facilities from financial institutions.

The fraud-involving two I-T offices in Thane and Kalyan was planned by those familiar with the I-T office functioning. For over two years, 2007-2008 and 2008-2009, the I-T officials disbursed tax refund cheques drawn from the SBI and credited into the account of fictitious assessees in a credit society in Dombivli. As many as 331 such tax refund cheques, some exceeding Rs 1 lakh, were subsequently routed to the Dombivli Nagri Cooperative Bank and funds withdrawn. The I-T refunds are account payee cheques, which can’t be transferred. Despite this, all 331 refund orders were credited to the third-party account of a credit society.', 'The Saradha Group financial scandal was a major financial scam and alleged political scandal caused by the collapse of a Ponzi scheme run by Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private companies that were believed to be running collective investment schemes popularly but incorrectly referred to as chit funds in Eastern India. It was feared that legitimate non-banking financial companies and microfinance institutions would be stigmatized, leading to a vicious cycle of low depositor trust, higher interest rates, lower lending and a localized credit crisis. Because most of the Saradha Group depositors came from the lowest economic strata, the loss of the investment would cause a further decrease in social mobility. The scandal drew attention to similar illegal deposit mobilizing companies, which are facing increased regulatory pressure. Many of these companies have been variations of timeshare travel schemes, of which there are few clear regulations. In August 2013, the Central Government amended the SEBI Act and gave SEBI powers to search and seize without prior magisterial permission to investigate illegal money collection schemes.', 'NSEL case relates to a payment default at the National Spot Exchange Limited that occurred in 2013 involving Financial Technologies India Ltd when a payment default took place after a commodities market regulator, the Forward Markets Commission (FMC), directed NSEL to stop launching contracts. This led to the closure of the Exchange in July 2013. Three spot exchanges, NSEL, NSPOT, and National APMC were exempted by the government under Section 27 of FCRA to conduct forward trading in one-day contracts. This was done to boost volumes so that their economic viability improved. On the flawed recommendations of the FMC, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs ordered NSEL to settle all existing contracts and not launch any fresh contracts, which led to the crisis. Investigations led by Enforcement Directorate (ED) and Economic Offences Wing (EOW) revealed the role of brokers and defaulters in the NSEL case. The brokers mis-sold NSEL products to their clients by assuring them of fixed returns. The defaulters hypothecated stocks and produced fake warehouse receipts and siphoned the entire default money. FIU (under Finance Ministry) held that NSEL came under the purview of the Forwarding Contracts (Regulation) Act (FCRA) and therefore guilty of failing in several of these obligations under the law. The black money watchdog has slapped a penalty of Rs 1.66 crore for several counts of violating the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) on NSEL. The watchdog further held that failures are deliberate and willful and hence, invite penalties.', 'The NSE co-location scam relates to the market manipulation at the National Stock Exchange of India, India’s leading stock exchange.

Nirav, his wife Ami Modi, brother Nishal Modi and uncle Mehul Choksi, all partners of the firms, M/s Diamond R US, M/s Solar Exports and M/s Stellar Diamonds; along with PNB officials and employees, and directors of Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi’s firms have all been named in a charge sheet by the CBI. The bank initially said that two of its employees at the branch were involved in the scam, as the bank’s core banking system was bypassed when the corrupt employees issued LOUs to overseas branches of other Indian banks, including Allahabad Bank, Axis Bank, and Union Bank of India, using the international financial communication system, SWIFT. On 1 March 2018, the government approved the Fugitive Economic Offenders Bill to deter economic offenders from evading the process of Indian law by giving powers to the government to confiscate assets of a fugitive, including Benami assets of absconding loan defaulters. The bill covers a wide range of economic offenders which include: loan defaulters, fraudsters, individuals who violate laws governing taxes, black money, Benami properties, the financial sector, and corruption. In March 2018, the Reserve Bank of India scrapped banking instruments such as the Letter of understanding (Lou) and Letter of Comfort (LoC) that in an attempt to plug a loophole and improve banks’ due diligence in trade credit. Some bankers said that LoUs and LoCs led to receiving banks depending completely on the issuing bank on creditworthiness.', 'As seen in all the above cases for scams like Nirav Modi, the two factors: action taken by the insiders or systemic loopholes were responsible for the majority of the Indian financial scams.

The disease, one hopes, will be brought under control quickly, but the International Monetary Fund is already warning that economic growth in\\xa0 China may slow.\\xa0 As we watch the situation unfold, three broader risks to the global economy are also becoming more apparent and clear.', 'The first risk is obviously in China itself. While the precise\\norigins of the disease remain unclear, it is hard to take a definite view on\\nwhether outbreaks of this kind could be avoided – for example, by better\\ncontrol over hygiene in food markets. But it is painfully obvious that a lack\\nof transparency in China has contributed to fear and even signs of panic around\\nthe world.', 'As financial markets go down in 2007-2008, when the precise incidence of big risks is not well understood, people tend to assume the worse.

Notification bars are ever abuzz with news about when these celebrities wake up, what they wear to the gym, what they eat, and where they go on their vacations. In the idealized and idolized eyes with which society views celebrities, this unceasing visibility gives them an all-pervasive influence. The dominance of celebrities in swaying opinions of their acolyte is well-established – from', ' advertisements in the print', ' and pixel mediums, brand endorsements, and integrations, the evidence of exploiting celebrity influence is vast. However, today more than ever before, this influence is creeping away from the world of consumerism and into governance, policy, and politics. With an increasing number of public figures overtly taking strong and stronger political stances, making moves charged with a political motive, and eventually entering the sphere of legislature and bureaucracy, the scope of having a public influence has come to mean much more than it used to, thereby begging the question – how well-placed are personage in the world of politics? Should celebrities be allowed to join politics?', 'The interplay between the seemingly contrasting worlds of celebrities and policy-makers have come into increasing contact, in India and the rest of the world-leading pop-music artists back presidential candidates, internationally acclaimed actors attempt international diplomacy, films are claimed to be vehicles of political messaging, Prime Ministerial banquets engage celluloid stars, and so on. The ‘influence’ that stars exert on the world of politics seems to encapsulate an entire spectrum of involvement – at the zenith of which are the celebrities who actually set foot into parliamentary assemblies and councils, to represent the public that they once only influenced.', 'Although the phenomenon of the seeping of public influence into public policy has stretched through much of the 20', 'th', ' century, Choi and Berger (2001) suggest that the celebrity-politics connect continues to strengthen, much more than it did a few decades ago, as we trudge further into the century. Of the myriad causalities that underlie this circumstance, the global internet, where fame isn’t restricted to the confines of tangible achievement has been theorized to be a significant driver. In her 2009 book, Hyde labels this spectacle as a ‘mission creep’, where the enterprise of celebrities is expanding beyond its primary goals.', 'A prodigious public following seems to be the parallel between the worlds of politics and personage, which paves ', 'the path for celebrities', ' to cross over to politics. Celebrities seem to be able to transition into politics with a certain grace, having already learned to live in the public’s eye, and established themselves, allowing the carry-over of their already-known traits as celebrities into their role as policy-makers. The visibility that autochthonous politicians work years to nurture, celebrities already have as they descend into the political sphere. In one of the best-known instances of a celebrity transitioning into politics, Ronald Reagan walked away from Hollywood and into the White House, carrying with him his trademark charismatic on-screen personality that spilled over into his politics. Initially serving as the governor of California for 15 years in the late 1960s, Reagan served two terms at the Oval Office. The voters knew who Ronald was – those who closely followed the trends of the red and blue – but also those who did not, giving Reagan the edge that propelled him towards success. On the other side of the globe, India saw much the same trend as an on-screen persona aiding the creation of an off-screen political career. Ramanand Sagar’s television series ‘Ramayan’, based on the Hindu mythological epic, was revolutionary in the pious Indian society of the 1980s when television shows were still novel. It has been recounted on many an occasion that audiences would often offer their prayers to the television screen, every time Arun Govil, who portrayed the deity ‘Ram’ made an appearance on screen. Having garnered a devout, dutiful fan following, Govil, and his other co-actors from the show turned to the world of politics, where their godly association in the public’s eyes helped them make a mark. Even the Philippines has shown ample evidence of celebrities time and again swooping in to claim political victory with their stardom and popularity, that their opponents lack.', 'Very often, the sentiment of anti-incumbency seems to be the golden ticket that lets celebrity politicians snatch political power from consummate politicians. Indeed, various political theorists suggest that anti-incumbency happens to be amongst the more effective strategies to secure vote banks. Until 31', 'st', ' December 2018, Ukrainian actor, screenwriter, and director Volodymyr Zelensky only played the lead in a sitcom that tells the story of a schoolteacher who accidentally becomes the president. It was that winter that Zelensky claimed that he was contesting the presidential elections to “change the mood and timbre of the political establishment” and to “bring professional, decent people to power”. Zelensky took the premise of his wildly popular show from the reel to the real, as he crushed rival, a seasoned politician, and incumbent Poroshenko in a landslide victory. Has Zelensky proved a better representative of his people than his predecessor? Time is yet to deliver its verdict. But the gushes that he invoked in the people of Ukraine, and his plea to oust ‘the ruling class’ played their role in assuring Zelensky 73% of the plebiscite. In the early 2010s in India, similar anti-incumbent sentimentalities were played into by the many celebrities including musician Vishal Dadlani, hockey legend Dhanraj Pillay, singer Jaspinder Narula, and others – all of whom joined hands with Arvind Kejriwal’s\\xa0 ‘Aam Aadmi’ movement that aimed to rid the existing political system of its ills.', 'And so, innumerable celebrities across countries and cultures claim the throne. In fact, a Wikipedia page that maintains an inventory of actor-politician spanning the atlas claims that it ‘may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness’ – depicting the sheer number of celebrities who reroute to politics. This begets questioning the congruence of the world of personage and that of politics.\\xa0', 'In a research article published in 1995, Meyer and Gamson articulated the possibility of celebrities choosing to politically address only broadly acceptable social causes because they understand their power rests with staying popular, thereby failing to make any appreciable difference. This seems to ring true with some celebrity politicians in India, especially ones who are nominated to the Upper House of the Parliament but fail abysmally to leave a mark. One of many such representatives is Gautam Gambhir, a cricketer-turned-politician who has mostly been shunned for his abject performance in the parliament. Hema Malini, another popular actress who turned to politics, came under heavy criticism when her claim to be a protector of women’s rights wasn’t backed by an effort to fulfill her promises. Owing to such instances, research findings such as those by Nisbett and DeWalt (2016) find that the public often questions the intentions of the celebrities who venture into politics. It may also seem that in entering politics and failing to deliver, celebrity politicians often deprive grass-root political workers of the chance to enter the mainstream of politics.', 'However, there is ample evidence from around the globe that goes to prove that celebrities can, in fact, make their mark in the world of governance, independent of their primary identities. Take the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, for instance, where the political ethos has been consistently overshadowed by celebrities from the world of showbiz, for at least the last 40 years.', ' As per data', ' from the Ministry of Statistics & Programme Implementation, Tamil Nadu is amongst the top-performing states in the country, having the second-highest GDP. Most celebrities in Tamil Nadu who approached politics have exhibited extraordinary political will and caliber. The late actor-politician J. Jayalalithaa, or ‘Amma’, ran successful terms as chief minister and is still considered a mother figure by hordes of her followers. Another stalwart in the landscape of Tamil Nadu, Dr. MG Ramachandran, continues to be celebrated as one of the most influential chief ministers and is lauded for his large-scale reforms. In being the forerunner of some of the changes that propelled the state towards progress, including easing caste tensions and other communal violence, ‘MGR’ as he is better known, is remembered as much for his governance as he is for his innings on screen.', 'More often than not, celebrity engagement in politics has been used to woo voters from the younger strata of the population. Empirical studies such as the one by Austin, Vord, Pinkleton, and Epstein (2008), have conclusively shown to enhance political engagement by younger voters.\\xa0 Along similar lines, Jackson (2008) found that young people are more likely to agree with political positions that are endorsed by politicians. In fact, many modern political theorists are of the belief that the involvement of celebrities in politics allows for otherwise uninvolved or apathetic veins of the demographic, to be active participants in democracy. Hillary Clinton aimed to do just that when she got the Billboard-topping artists Beyonce and Jay-Z to take center-stage at her rally in Cleveland, in the weeks leading up to the 2016 US presidential elections – in fact, as multiple sources suggest, this rally did see a surge in millennial supporters. In such a case, it might be in the benefit of the community to have more celebrities endorse and engage in politics in order to nurture a more vibrant and engaged youth.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0', 'From our vantage point today, the relationship between personage and politics seems to be a central fixture in society and is here to stay. What remains to be done, however, is to ensure the symbiotic course of this relationship – to scrutinize and critique the celebrities who knock the doors of politics and to secure their promises of beneficence and non-maleficence to the public that it seeks to serve. Yet, it may seem that these are benchmarks that need to be met by any and all servants of the people – celebrity or not, but in the world that we live in, this is certainly not the case. Politicians – celebrity or not, largely happen upon the sphere of governance without a lot of experience backing them and learn to navigate the maze of politics on the job. Ultimately, like all things in democracy, the government is of the people and its representatives are of them, and for them. The eventual endorsement of its leaders – celebrity or not – can come, not from data-based analyses and elaborate critique, but from the people. Should celebrities be allowed to enter politics? The question remains unanswered. Or rather, is answered by the democratic exercise itself – with the beeps of electronic ballots election after election, when the people – the real ‘influencers’, choose.'])\n",

The state of the public healthcare system, still vast, is very fragmented and cannot scale up rapidly enough to face the challenge of a pandemic such as COVID-19. The origin of public healthcare lies in the British colonial period where such facilities were provided only to British officers and their families stationed in India. From the 1960s onwards, the independent government of India stressed more upon healthcare and it led to the creation of the modern public healthcare system in India. The healthcare system is organized into primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. At the primary level are Sub Centre’s and Primary Health Centre’s (PHCs). At the secondary level there are Community Health Centre’s (CHCs) and smaller Sub-District hospitals. Finally, the top level of public care provided by the government is the tertiary level, which consists of Medical Colleges and District/General Hospitals. The number of PHCs, CHCs, Sub Centre’s, and District Hospitals has increased in the past six years, although not all of them are up to the standards set by Indian Public Health Standards. But there are still critical challenges to the existing system.', 'One of the major areas is the lack of awareness of diseases, especially communicable diseases among the general population of India. This challenge becomes more complicated at the lower strata of society, especially poor households, migrant laborers and homeless people who do not have the proper channels of communication available to get the necessary information from the health experts. Add low educational status, poor functional literacy, low accent on education within the healthcare system, and low priority for health in the population, among others and you see the magnitude of the problem. According to a recent study initiated by the faculty and students of IIT-Hyderabad and IIT-Bombay, in Tier-1 cities, it was found that about 12 percent of the respondents switched from public to private mode during the third week of COVID-19. This modal shift was about 9 percent in Tier-2 cities and about 7 percent in Tier-3 cities. Moreover, nearly 48 percent of people said that they did not travel to work during the third week of March, whereas 28 percent had the same frequency of travel to work. When inquired about the cancellation of trips between the cities using major modes of transportation, around 18 percent said they cancelled their flights whereas, 20 per cent of respondents cancelled their train journeys. This indicates that awareness about COVID-19 is higher in Tier-1 cities, in comparison with Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. But national level, state level and door-to-door campaigns along with targeted media campaigns may enable the knowledge of the pandemic to spread fast among the local populace.', 'The second challenge is access to public healthcare in India. Access (to healthcare) is defined by the Oxford dictionary as “The right or opportunity to use or benefit from (healthcare)” Physical reach is one of the basic determinants of access, defined as “ the ability to enter a healthcare facility within 5 km from the place of residence or work”. Using this definition, a study in India in 2012 found that in rural areas, only 37% of people were able to access IP facilities within a 5 km distance, and 68% were able to access out-patient facilities. Furthermore, it was postulated that in general, the more rustic (rural) one’s existence – the further one lives from towns – the greater are the odds of disease, malnourishment, weakness, and premature death.', 'The third is the planning portion related to the preparedness of the pandemic. Planning for a pandemic such as COVID-19 has never been done extensively in India as we had no recent history of such a communicable disease which spreads rapidly in crowded locations, which about a quarter of the population live in. The recent national lockdown called led to an increase in police violence who have not been sensitized how to deal in such a crisis and the humanitarian crisis facing migrant laborers, an important part of the Indian economy, who have lost their jobs and facing a lack of public transport, have to force to walk thousands of miles to reach their native villages. The ongoing slump in the economy has been further exacerbated by the pandemic and the resultant lockdown. And there have been growing complaints by healthcare professionals, who are fighting in the front of this pandemic, of lack of Protective Personal Equipment’s (PPE’s) to protect themselves and their patients from COVID-19. The lockdown has hit HIV+ and chronic patients hard who need constant medication to maintain their fragile condition. Elderly people, who are often alone and have medical conditions, have been left without essential support. Ironically, these are the same group of people who are at an immediate threat from COVID-19.', 'I am optimistically hoping, based on the ingenious and creativity of our citizens, that we tide over these tough times and fundamental changes to our healthcare system are made with this sober learning experience to prevent a repeat of what is happening today.'])\n",

This is also true for the epidemiologists and virologists who have been warning the world since January that the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus poses a severe threat to public health around the world. The name Coronavirus itself, is vicious enough to terrify those who otherwise are fearless in the face of any ball game. Tracing back the origins of the now pandemic, we find that the coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in China’s Hubei province, in late 2019. Cases of the disease grew by several thousand per day in China in late January and early February, the peak of the epidemic there. The number of infections appearing each day has since plummeted in China, making the outbreak a global pandemic that has engulfed over 214 countries around the globe.', 'Besides being a health crisis, the virus has already brought a major downfall in the world economy with the IMF estimating the coronavirus-induced global downturn to be ‘way worse’ than financial crisis. As the coronavirus spreads across the globe, it appears to be setting off a devastating feedback loop with another of the gravest forces of our time: economic inequality. Research suggests that those in lower economic strata are likelier to catch the disease owing to their inability to meet the rising drug prices. According to the International Labour Organization(ILO), COVID-19 will have far-reaching impacts on labor market outcomes. Beyond the urgent concerns about the health of workers and their families, the virus and the subsequent economic shocks will impact the world of work across three key dimensions.', 'Initial ILO estimates point to a significant rise in unemployment and underemployment in the wake of the virus. Based on different scenarios for the impact of COVID-19 on global GDP growth, preliminary ILO estimates indicate a rise in global unemployment of between 5.3 million (“low” scenario) and 24.7 million (“high” scenario) from a base level of 188 million in 2019. The “mid” scenario suggests an increase of 13 million (7.4 million in high-income countries). Though these estimates remain highly uncertain, all figures indicate a substantial rise in global unemployment. For comparison, the global financial crisis of 2008-9 increased unemployment by 22 million. While self-employment does not typically react to economic downturns, it acts as a “default” option for survival or maintaining income – often in the informal economy. For this reason, informal employment tends to increase during crises. However, the current limitations on the movement of people and goods may restrict this type of coping mechanism.', 'Labour supply is declining because of quarantine measures and a fall in economic activity.\\xa0At this point, a preliminary estimate suggests that\\xa0infected workers have already lost nearly 30,000 work months, with the consequent loss of income (for unprotected workers). Employment impacts imply large income losses for workers. Overall losses in labour income are expected in the range of between 860 and 3,440 billion USD.\\xa0The loss of labour income will translate into lower consumption of goods and services, which is detrimental to the continuity of businesses and ensuring that economies are resilient. Working poverty is also likely to increase significantly.\\xa0The strain on incomes resulting from the decline in economic activity will devastate workers close to or below the poverty line. The growth impacts of the virus used for the unemployment estimates above suggest an additional 8.8 million people in working poverty around the world than originally estimated (i.e. an overall decline of 5.2 million working poor in 2020 compared to a decline of 14 million estimated pre-COVID-19). Under the mid and high scenarios, there will be between 20.1 million and 35.0 million more people in working poverty than before the pre-COVID-19 estimate for 2020.', 'Who are particularly vulnerable?Epidemics and economic crises can have a disproportionate impact on certain segments of the population, which can trigger worsening inequality.\\xa0Based on past experience and current information on the COVID-19 pandemic and insights from previous crises, a number of groups can be identified:', 'Those with underlying health conditions and older people\\xa0are most at risk of developing serious health issues.', 'Young persons, already facing higher rates of unemployment and underemployment, are more vulnerable to falling labor demand, as witnessed during the global financial crisis.\\xa0', 'Women\\xa0are over-represented in more affected sectors (such as services) or in occupations that are at the front line of dealing with the pandemic (e.g. nurses). The ILO estimates that 58.6 percent of employed women work in the services sector around the world, compared to 45.4 percent of men.', 'Unprotected workers, including the self-employed, casual, and gig workers, are likely to be disproportionately hit by the virus as they do not have access to paid or sick leave mechanisms, and are less protected by conventional social protection mechanisms and other forms of income smoothing.', 'Migrant workers\\xa0are particularly vulnerable to the impact of the COVID-19 crisis, which will constrain both their ability to access their places of work in destination countries and return to their families.', 'The extent and severity to which the coronavirus pandemic will impact the fight to end extreme poverty is still unknown, but it is expected that the crisis will devastate the world’s most vulnerable people including the world of work. The virus is already disproportionately impacting the poor in wealthy countries, where the most known cases are concentrated. Experts are urging the world to prepare to lend extra support to low-income countries to address the pandemic. COVID-19 cases are more likely to go undetected or to be under-detected in developing countries that have fewer resources available to tackle a pandemic.

These standards, adopted by representatives of governments, workers’ and employers’ organizations, provide a human-centered approach to growth and development, including by triggering policy levers that both stimulate demand and protect workers and enterprises.', 'Policy responses should focus on two immediate goals: Health protection measures and economic support on both the demand- and supply-side of the associated cause.', 'First, workers and employers and their families should be protected from the health risks of COVID-19. Protective measures at the workplace and across communities should be introduced and strengthened, requiring large-scale public support and investment.', 'Second, timely, large-scale, and coordinated policy efforts should be taken to provide employment and income support and to stimulate the economy and labor demand. These measures not only cushion enterprises and workers against immediate employment and income losses, but they also help prevent a chain of supply shocks (e.g. losses in workers’ productivity capacities) and demand shocks (e.g. suppressing consumption among workers and their families) that could lead to a prolonged economic recession.', 'In such challenging times, many countries have come forward to protect their workers in the workplace with decisive measures to combat the spread of the disease, while ameliorating its pernicious effect on the economy and labor market across the three policy pillars: protecting workers in the workplace, stimulating the economy and labor demand, and supporting employment and income. Some of the policies include', ' Working arrangements, including telework; Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) advice; Expanded access to paid sick leave; Prevention of discrimination and exclusion.', ' While these measures will no doubt help to contain the pandemic, to respond to the emergency needs it has generated and to pave the way to a gradual recovery, it is clear that more needs to be done.

It’s a test, too, of a different kind of faith, in the strength of the ideas humans choose to help them form moral judgments and guide personal and social behavior. The epidemic forces everyone to confront deep questions of human existence, questions so profound that they have previously been answered, in many different ways, by the greatest philosophers. It’s a test of where all humans stand. What is right and what is wrong? What can individuals expect from society, and what can society expect of them?

While, both would be controversial, a taboo is more likely to draw a flack than a debatable topic.', 'The campaign should be more focussed on the issue than on the brand itself. As a result, the debate would be about the issue and not the brand.', 'The campaign should always promote a respectful and healthy discussion; not a fight or abuse. It should present the facts and avoid over-sensitising the issues.', 'No issue/current situation should be exploited to a point where it becomes the tone of the firm. If a controversy does not settle down early, over the time it would become a part of the image of the company.', 'The firm should be always prepared with a contingency plan or a proper response in case if the campaign backfires or does not take the expected course.', 'Advantages of controversial marketing:', 'Increasing awareness: A well crafted ad can draw the attention of the unaware audience, making them explore the brands’ product portfolio. Some of them, might be potential customers.', 'Shifting Brand Image: A brand always needs to evolve, as per the needs of its target audience. Here, a controversial marketing strategy could be used to shift the image in a short span. It could also define the future path for the brand.', 'Emotional Connect: If a brand is successful in winning the heart of a consumer, it half the job is done. Even if a controversy can divide the audience, some will appreciate the message of the brand. They will relate more to the brand and can become loyalists.', 'Start a meaningful discussion: Particularly if the campaign is designed around a social issue; the campaign not only becomes relevant to the company but also to the society. It breaks the stigma around a topic that people frown to talk about. By communicating to the masses about such a topic, the company eases the air, which can lead to healthy discussions.', 'Boost Sales: The most important aspect. If the brand is able to build on the sudden increase in awareness among people, it could boost sales and profitability.', '\\xa0Disadvantages of controversial marketing:', 'Offensive: In present times, the audience have become highly sensitive and a controversial ad will definitely offend someone. So, we have to weigh the benefits and drawbacks before creating something controversial.', 'Ruin brand reputation: As stated earlier, it puts a high risk on brand reputation. For some consumers, a controversy might also become a reason to not buy the product or service. Specifically, in case of media houses, if a media house gets involved in controversies often, then that reduces their credibility.', 'While it can increase the awareness in a short span of time, it won’t work in the long run as this attention is short lived.', 'Internet. They say, anything that goes on the internet, stays on the internet. Due to rise of social media, people have become more conscious of their choices and try to thoroughly evaluate everything. As a result, even one controversial campaign will not be forgotten. Years from now, if the company tries to change their opinion on some issue, then these old controversies will again come up and harm them deeply.', 'A controversial campaign can also attract legal penalties, if it ends up leading to disharmony in the society.', 'Examples of controversial marketing strategies:', 'Movie makers frequently follow controversy as a tactic to create a buzz around their upcoming movie.', 'Nike came up with “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” campaign that had Colin Kaepernick who was outcast from NFL as he kneeled during National Anthem to protest against racial inequality in NFL. The ad was a huge success, and Nike’s sales rose by31%.', 'The UN’s Women’s “Auto-complete truth” was a huge success as a campaign, and garnered huge accolades from media houses. Here, it focused on gender gap and how it was perceived that some roles could never be donned by women.', 'Not all campaigns end in success. Zomato gathered a lot of backlash in its subtle advertising campaign where they used Indian slangs in their banners put up at public places.', 'Starbucks red-cup campaign. It created a huge buzz, and boosted sales, but it drove away a portion of Christian customers, who were offended by it.', 'In the end, we can say that controversial marketing is a double-edged sword. On one side, it benefits the firm by increasing its reach to the masses, and making more people conscious about the brand; on the other, it puts the brand value itself at stake. So, it has to be carefully planned, and a backup measure should always be kept ready to reduce the impact in case it backfires.\\xa0 Every such campaign should be thoroughly weighed in for the losses and benefits before execution.'])\n",

Such remote functioning at scale is unprecedented and can leave a long-lasting impression on the way people live and work for several years to return. China, which felt the primary impact of the pandemic, was an early mover during this space. As home to a number of the world’s largest firms, it offers lessons for people who are just commencing to embrace the shift. Working from home skyrocketed in China within the wake of the COVID-19 crisis as companies ', 'told their employees to remain home.', ' Around 200 million people were working remotely by the tip of the Chinese New Year holiday. While this arrangement has some benefits, like avoiding long commutes, many employees and firms found it challenging. One employee at a web company quipped his workday changed from ‘996’ to ‘007,’ meaning from nine to nine, 6 days every week, to all or any the time. On the private front, employees found it difficult to manage kids’ home-schooling via video conference while coordinating with remote colleagues.

Being isolated ends up in uncertainty about who to speak to on specific issues and the way and when to approach them, resulting in hold-ups and delays. That’s why establishing a structure and architecture for deciding and effective communication is vital. Here, smaller cross-functional teams are helpful, each with a transparent mission and reporting line, where directions and tasks are easy to implement.

With fewer in each team, there’s longer to urge to understand one another and build the trust that will grow more organically within the office. At Ping An Insurance, workers are typically grouped in project teams of, at most, 30 members, while larger business units are divided to assist them to stay agile. Strong company-wide foundations underpin this, like having a typical purpose and unified goals. Providing clarity on what decisions to escalate and which of them is tackled at the team level helps drive progress. To mitigate the consequences of closed retail stores, one leading fashion company founded a technique room and redeployed staff into four cross-functional squads to support its front-line. It designed standard ways for live broadcasting and established internal best practices to encourage front-line staff to use new retail tools to drive sales remotely.', '\\xa0The lesson: putting in small, cross-functional teams with clear objectives and a typical purpose keeps everyone on the identical strategic course.', 'Leading from afar due to impacts of COVID-19 on the world of work', 'Managing people is one of the foremost difficult elements of remote working, not least because everyone will respond differently to the cultural shift and challenges of the home-working environment. Leaders have to energize the entire company by setting a transparent direction and communicating it effectively.

It’s essential to foster an outcome-driven culture that empowers and holds teams answerable for getting things done while encouraging open, honest, and productive communication.

Upping the amount of interaction can even work well here. One chief information officer, responding to a McKinsey survey, said he’s texting the whole company with regular updates because it’s a more human way of communicating than via the official corporate channels. When working within distributed teams, e-commerce giant Alibaba increases the frequency of its one-to-one communications with employees to a weekly basis and, in some teams, members submit a weekly report for his or her colleagues, complete with plans for the week ahead.

', 'Empathy may be a crucial tool here', ', offering how to attach, promote inclusiveness, and make a way of community in a very barren of physical interaction. Increasing social interactions within the team, particularly through one-on-one catch-up, guards against feelings of isolation and demoralization and creates space for people to talk up and share their thoughts. By creating a way of psychological safety for his or her colleagues, being inclusive in deciding, and offering perspective in challenging moments, managers can stay closer to what’s occurring, surface issues, and help their teams solve problems effectively. A similar approach is very important when coping with customers and clients, providing valuable stability and enabling them to navigate unknown waters confidently. As an example, one global bank asked their relationship managers to attach with small-business customers via WeChat and video calls to know their situation and help them weather the crisis. To try and do so effectively at scale, the managers are supported through dedicated product programs, online articles, scripts for communicating with clients, and internal training. Inclusion is that the ultimate show of empathy. Creating outlets for sharing best practices, success stories, challenges, and water-cooler chat are significant to making a person’s connection.

To address the challenge of launching a digital business with an oversized remote team, one company created a replacement workflow for product requirements that clearly outlined the use of digital tools, roles, and responsibilities as requirements moved from ideation to validation to delivery stages.

Leadership teams that continuously learn actively identify best practices, and rapidly founded mechanisms to share ideas across the organization tend to be most successful within the future. R&D teams at one leading high-tech manufacturer created a productivity target for remote work by estimating their productivity hebdomadally relative to onsite work and identifying levers to enhance it. Within four weeks, they had progressed from 50 percent to 88 percent of their baseline. As China’s workforce begins to return to offices, these lessons from a number of its leading companies help as an example of how—with the correct structure, culture, processes, and technology—working remotely can boost productivity and morale. Employees who spend less time traveling or commuting and have a much better work-life balance are likely to be happier, more motivated, and prepared to mobilize in extreme situations. Embracing remote working allows companies to define a brand new normal that drives productivity and employee satisfaction into the longer term. Alibaba launched TaoBao, by now the world’s biggest e-commerce website, while the staff was working remotely on quarantine during the 2003 SARS outbreak.

Marketing depends on a variety of parameters that can be classified broadly, boiling down to vital three. These are ‘What type of customer are marketing team is focusing on (based on gender, age, location, customer-class) (W1)’, ‘What are Product Specification or Applications you need to bring in front of customer (W2)’, ‘What is your Product Promotion flow path (W3)’, ‘How much time it takes to convey product information to customer (H1)’. These criteria are what I call ‘3W1H’ forms. These basics need to be taken care of while developing a marketing strategy for the upcoming product. However, are they enough? No. There is one more parameter called the Feedback mechanism (FM). Generally, machines use the feedback mechanism to check output generated is as per input is given or not and if it is not, the input is corrected to get the required output. When it comes to human beings, he/she is surrounded by multiple products daily through social media, TV advertising and so forth. Slight uncertainties on either side in observation can make a positive or negative impact on the product on the consumer’s mind. In the feedback mechanism, the marketing team needs to answer only one question “What kind of product image built in the customer mind through promotional activities?” If the product image not built as per expectation, then management has to review and work on 3W1H, as discussed earlier. So let’s elaborate how 3W1H approach works along with feedback mechanism. ', '          Fig.1- 3W1H with FM process can target customer effectively          ', 'After deciding the customer range, you can work on other\\nactivities. Since the customer is\\nconscious about purchasing the product and\\nwhen the product promoted, the first thing the customer will check is its\\nusefulness, and if his/her answer is ‘Yes,’\\nthen the customer will start comparing with similar alternative products in the\\nmarket. Therefore, one should present the\\nproduct along with some unique thought\\nand express the product in such a way that its image imprinted into the consumer\\nmind. For example, the polio campaign in\\nIndia. The government had taken the initiative to make India polio-free by\\nspreading awareness through all types of social communication mediums, in which\\nTelevision played a vital role. Legendary\\ncinema actor ‘Amitabh Bachchan’ was selected as an ambassador for this campaign.\\nInitially, the advertisement published in which Amitabh pleaded people for vaccinating\\nthe children within a fixed schedule. The advertisement circulated throughout the nation, and\\nno stone was kept unturned by the government\\nto make this campaign successful. However,\\nmuch to the surprise, advertising failed miserably to attract a deprived community in polio booth. This promotion failure was because of\\nnon-consideration of the customer (W1)\\nand how advertise impacted its application on the customer (W2)? So after analysing failure, experts recommended changes\\nin their marketing campaign like, to focus on major customer (Here mainly\\nvillage woman who generally spend their time in home by watching TV), type of\\nimpact on people (People who watched TV during that era, had an image of\\nAmitabh as ‘Angry young man’). So the campaign\\nimproved their advertising by bringing out the same angry Amitabh instead of\\nhis soft-image, which used in the earlier campaign.

During the same time, some instances of Nanos catching fire came\\ninto focus, which worsened the situation.\\nThis case even exacerbates when the team\\ndid not work on the feedback mechanism\\nand hence, was not able to change customer\\nperception about Nano.

These are a type of virus that creates sickness in humans. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A newly identified type has caused a recent outbreak of respiratory illness now called COVID-19.', 'The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Coronaviruses vary significantly in the risk factors. Some can kill more than 30% of those infected and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold. Coronaviruses cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids, occurring primarily in the winter and early spring seasons.', 'As it creates much chaos between humans and also affected the whole human diversity, it also creates a disturbance in the economy. The economy is the largest system of trade and industry by which the wealth of a country is made and used. If this economy will not work then the human race will also come to an end. So not only COVID-19 makes the humans sick but also it makes the economy a viral whole. ', 'The impact of coronavirus firstly affects Economic growth which is the factor that creates nation wealth. Economic growth creates wealth on a national scale for the government in the form of taxation, which is then redistributed accordingly to the services and communities that need it the most. Due to COVID-19 industrial production, sales and investment all fell in the first two months of the year which decline the whole economic growth. Such a slowdown in manufacturing industries has hurt countries that are interlinked to each other in terms of exports i.e. Asia Pacific economies, sub-Saharan economies and the USA economies. A reduction in global economic activity has lowered the demand for oil, taking oil prices to multi-year lows. This happens even before a disagreement on production cuts between OPEC and its allies caused the plunge in oil prices.', 'Job creation and employment opportunities are the second most factor which was affected by coronavirus as it often requires the skills and some wilful hands which necessitate in the long term of the business. Longer lasting and more intensive outbreak have half growth the opportunities in 2020 as factories suspend their activity and workers stay at home to try to avoid the virus.', 'Poverty is the third and most important factor which is diversely affected by COVID-19 as employment is not there and everyone was ordered to stay at home. When people will be in their own houses then automatically poverty will increase complimenting the decrease in economic growth.', 'There is also a big shift in stock markets, where shares in companies are bought and sold, affected many investments by the investors and shareholders or individual savings accounts. Central banks in many countries, including India, have slashed interest rates. Supermarkets and online delivery services also have huge growth in demand as customers stockpile goods such as hand sanitizers, toilet paper, rice, and orange juice etc.as the pandemic escalates.', 'At last the COVID-19 normally called coronavirus affects the world economy in a much-disintegrated manner.

India did the same in 1991 after being\\nbacked into a corner by the balance of payments crisis.

The insurance market was opened up in August 2000 by the then recently formed Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDAI), and 18 years on there has been a noticeable change. According to a research publication by Swiss Re, life insurance penetration, which is the ratio of total life insurance premium underwritten to the GDP of the country, has come up from 2.15% in 2001 to 2.76% in 2017, hitting a peak of 4.60% in 2009. The drop-in insurance penetration is attributed to lesser consumer spending in the aftermath of the global financial crisis and not a systemic issue with the Indian insurance market. Life insurance density or life insurance is underwritten per capita, has increased six times from USD 9.10 in 2001 to USD 55 in 2017. However, the global average insurance penetration rate, including both life and non-life insurance stands at 6.13% compared to India’s 3.69%. Some of our Asian neighbors, such as Thailand (5.29%), China (4.57%) and Malaysia (4.77%) to have outdone us in this regard. Their insurance density is also far superior; the figures for Malaysia, Thailand and China during the same period i.e. 2016 were USD 486, USD 348 and USD 384 respectively compared to USD 73 for India.', 'Like India, these countries have an open insurance market where foreign firms are allowed to enter and impart funds and technological expertise. However, the challenges and nuances that are involved in ensuring greater coverage and access to information for Indian citizens are far different than the ones there. As of 2010, only 7.5% of the Indian population had access to the internet, compared to 56.3%, 34.3% and 22.4% for Malaysia, China, and Thailand respectively. This made them better equipped to fully utilize technological innovations in the insurance sector compared to India. However, with the increasing availability of smartphones, reduced internet tariffs and fast adoption of digital technology, the number of internet users in India stood at 422 million in 2017 according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) annual report, which is roughly 32% of the total population. The telecom ministry expects the number to reach 730 million by 2020.', 'The key here is to be well poised to take full advantage of rapid internet availability to boost further penetration in the Indian insurance sector and encourage further innovation and liberalization. A lot of emphasis on insurance technology now is laid on Big Data, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. PolicyBazaar, which began as a website for simply comparing insurance policy prices has now become India’s largest online policy marketplace, with a market share of 50% in the online insurance space. With a large repository of data gathered over the years, the Yashish Dahiya founded the company is able to offer unique products only sold on PolicyBazaar based on customer profiles, such as pay-per-use motor insurance and insurance policies for a term of up to a hundred years. Using data analytics, the website can also recommend products and add-ons based on the customer’s search trends and profile, to ensure a higher chance that the customer will buy the policy. Aureus Analytics, an Analytics firm founded by Anurag Shah, aims to leverage advanced analytics and machine learning to counter fraud by developing predictive models to assess the probability of a claim being fraudulent. They also use this data to generate customer risk profiles and help speed up the claims settlement. Bajaj Allianz General Insurance has used IoT to introduce an insurance cover for school children during their travel in a school bus. The school children are tracked in real-time using GPS beacons in their identity cards and are protected against accidents under the insurance cover. A working group set up by the IRDAI in January 2018 has submitted a report recommending insurance companies to use wearable fitness devices to track a customer’s health such as blood pressure, heart rate and distance walked and use that data to adequately price premiums for life insurance. These developments indicate a clear shift towards the greater adoption of new technologies in the insurance sector. The huge potential that lies in the relatively untapped Indian insurance market has been realized and insurance companies must now work towards this end. The limits of FDI in the insurance sector was raised from 26% to 49% in 2014 and similar to single-brand retail, the government has been mulling increasing the FDI limit to 100%. According to an article by Advait Rao Palepu and Subrata Panda, who sourced their information from Venture Intelligence,\\xa0the total investments in insurance and insurance marketplace companies in India increased from USD 518 million in 2016 to USD 1.49 billion in 2018 led by global investment firms such as SoftBank, WestBridge, KKR, and Temasek. Armed with foreign funding, technology and copious amounts of data, the insurance sector in India is set to change in unprecedented ways. The spread of online insurance marketplaces will give greater access to information and options for purchasing policies to the rapidly growing base of Indian internet users, circumventing the need for brokers and lengthy paperwork, and what was once seen as a daunting process of selecting, paying for and claiming insurance policies will become more streamlined and efficient with the use of machine learning, analytics and automated processes.

Big data is simply data, but with a huge size. Data that is not just voluminous but also growing exponentially with time. Such data sets are so large and complex that it is not possible to store or process them using traditional data management tools. So, how huge can this data be? Social media sites like Facebook generate more than 500 terabytes of new data every day in the form of photos, video uploads, text messages, etc. A single\\xa0Jet engine\\xa0can generate\\xa0more than 10 terabytes\\xa0of data in\\xa030 minutes\\xa0of flight time. With many thousand flights per day, generation of data reaches up to many\\xa0petabytes. Data contained in these sets are not always structured. It can be semi-structured or even unstructured. When such is the size and dimension of data we can well imagine how complicated it must be to process and analyze it. Therefore, modern methods of data analysis are being developed and used to process the information contained in big data sets.', 'Opportunities  ', 'Now coming to the opportunities that Big Data provides, they are not just limited to healthcare. Big data analysis is now a disruptive technology which has intervened into numerous fields and proved its worth. Healthcare is no exception. Big data has the potential to change the entire dynamics of the healthcare industry and improve the quality of life of people. Healthcare industry is a very large and complicated system. It involves a lot of risks and always demands better care. However, when a large number of patients seek emergency care the complications as well as the cost rise exponentially. In India, many times, we even lack sufficient infrastructure to support the patients, there is a deficit of beds as well as doctors to provide treatment to the patients. For instance, when epidemics break out and lives are lost at a very alarming rate, we can easily gauge our helplessness. However, the scenario is certainly improving now. With the advent of digitization into the healthcare system, healthcare providers or practitioners are now having access to a huge amount of patient health data. This healthcare big data can be processed and analyzed to identify patient patterns more quickly and effectively. The information obtained can be extremely useful to figure out chronic health issues and provide preventive treatment plans well beforehand so as to curb that disease or disorder from occurring. This method is also known as predictive analysis and it is one of the most crucial benefits of big data in healthcare. This technology can help the healthcare industry in more ways than we can infer. Healthcare organizations that have implemented predictive analysis have witnessed a reduction in ER visits by providing support and care to patients and decreasing emergency situations.', 'Apart from reduced ER visits and timely treatment, there are many other benefits of big data and predictive analysis. Patients with high-risk life-threatening issues can be provided with more customized treatment facilities. Due to lack of data, there exists a lack of proper planning in hospitals. Under or over-booking of staff, lack of medical equipment, medicines, and other facilities are a result of inefficient budgeting and ill-management of finances. Using predictive analysis these problems can be solved which will lead to reduced costs and efficient management of finances. Better staff allocation and admission rate prediction shall facilitate improvement in daily operations of healthcare organizations. By using big data the effect of recency bias could be reduced as well. When we give more importance to recent events and tend to ignore the effect of the older ones, it may lead to incorrect decisions. This is known as recency bias. Big data also helps in preventing fraudulent activities which in turn prevents losses of insurance companies. ', 'Challenges  ', 'While all of this is changing the healthcare industry for the better, it is not that easy to reap the benefits of big data. There are a whole lot of challenges and vulnerabilities attached to its implementation. One of the biggest challenges is security. Healthcare big data contains the personal information and health history of patients. Acts of hacking, cyber theft and phishing pose a serious threat to these databases. Such data could be stolen and sold for huge sums of money. Protection of the patients’ privacy hence is a serious challenge to big data implementation. Also, the data would contain external data apart from medical information. The organization, therefore, has to take care of privacy, legal compliances, and government policies. Privacy and security of patients have to be given utmost importance and no breach of any kind can be permitted.', 'The next challenge is data classification and modeling. The size of the data is massive and it is less structured and heterogeneous. Classifying such massive data to identify relevant information is a big challenge. Modeling of such unstructured data is equally difficult. ', 'Storage and retrieval is another major challenge. Huge cloud servers with sufficient space are required to store such voluminous data. Also, the speed should be high so that uploading of data can be done hassle-free. The way storage is a challenge, retrieval also is a matter of concern. Integrating the data and getting all relevant systems to link each other is a tough job. ', 'The next challenge is a major one in my opinion. Finding the right\\ntalent who own the expertise to implement this modern technology is an arduous\\ntask. Shortage of required talent is a crisis in the market today. Even after\\nhiring the right talent it is a challenge to retain them. Scarce resources like\\ndata scientists are hard to find and even harder to retain. They are easily\\npoached by competitors. A good and efficient compensation strategy, conducive\\nwork environment, high incentives, opportunities for career growth and development\\ncan be some of the ways of retaining such intellectual talent.

The primary culprits of this have been Public Sector Banks who have given and renewed loans to unworthy corporates like Nirav Modi, Kingfisher Airlines. Another big blow to the banking sector came in September 2018 in the form of IL & FS crisis. Infrastructure Leasing and Financial Services, a publicly owned NBFC defaulted on loans worth Rs. 91000 Crore which led to a liquidity crisis across Indian NBFCs which had an impact on Indian banks as well.

While banks take a strategic risk aversion strategy to minimize risk, the phases they have been through are restored -> rationalize -> reinvent, they have clearly marked only the first phase of restore through strict regulations and compliances from the regulating bodies both in India and internationally. Making it clear that we are far away from seeing the risk-free banking utopia. Risk management is not the same as risk avoidance. It is about making risk-informed decision to diminish the probability of it affecting the bank. In the long term, it talks about sustained growth. And while processing these risks they must make sure that no new risk is created.', 'History has always been a keen teacher in reflecting our faults. The 2008 financial crisis has been one of the biggest eye-openers for banks. Through its inception, even the Bassel norms in 2012 underwent a huge change pertaining to different banking risks such as the supervision risk, operational risk, and liquidation risk. In the present when we are opening banking to a more digital platform it is more vulnerable to risks both old and new risks. Some of the contemporary risks would include cybersecurity risk and privacy risk. With the digital transformation setting, it is imperative that different banks would undergo disruption to create a unique model or an example to follow. By being the first to adopt the new technologies makes them the first to be exposed to vulnerability. To gain more attraction for customers banks are trying to highlight their easy to use services accessible from home. When it comes to banks the future is a double-edged sword. After all, the banks are involved in the nitty-gritty and the economy of the system, failure of which can reduce the nation into rubbles.

While they are trying to minimize problems pertaining to a cyber security risk, credit risk, and operations risk, they have yet to realize other kinds of risks that are influenced by external factors and directly or indirectly harm the bank management system. Prominent amongst these are the geopolitical and socio-political risk that arises due to the global penetration of banks in different cultures and countries without trying to adapt to the local situations. They might seem trivial, but the macroeconomic conditions guided by politics and regulations in a new emerging market can make or break the bank. The near future seems direr. With any bank coming with the prospectus of being in the game for indefinite years, they are more at risk with a potentially long-term effect on customer acquisition and customer service, two vital features in today’s banking prerogative for tomorrow’s banking. With upcoming technologies like the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence or human factors like population growth and mass migration, the long-term risk will be huge enough to outweigh the short gains got from managing short term risks. These may be caused due to reputational risk or conduct risk which as a non-metric risk is not quantifiable but are totally dependent on how banks portray themselves.', 'Over the years, banks have been provided with several regulations to create failsafe measures to avoid these risks. However, as banks advance and are trying to get more competitive, it has become imperative that the risks also differs. Banks must become more cautious and adopt new practical methods different from their rudimentary ways to counter them. A good risk management system is one that can support the bank’s abilities to react to short term risk all the while circumventing itself from long term risk that may occur sooner or later. Such efficiency is important because it can devise new operations and talent models to better cover risk without doing irredeemable damage. But it’s not just the system that needs to be efficient but the role professional plays is equally important. There is a need to have better decision-making capabilities that balance the gains with the losses incurred.

A lot of information about their buying patterns, demographics, transactions, service requests, etc are available with banks. This is being used efficiently to predict the propensity of a customer buying a specific product. While working in the analytics department, I collaborated with many sales teams which needed a rank-ordered list of potential future customers for direct mailer/cold calling campaigns. The campaigns usually contain an attractive offer specific to the product, like lower interest rate for a credit card, higher interest on savings account, etc. which are hedged by confidence that the significant number of customers from the ranked list would be up for buying the product, as opposed to the ones being contacted randomly. Not only potential customers for a product, but also which customers are having the mindset to close their account (Customer Attrition) is being predicted.', 'Data science algorithms such as Logistic Regression work well in predicting the probability of customer propensity to buy or customer attrition probability. For example, consider the below real-life business problem:', 'A leading MNC bank wants to formulate a strategy to curb the\\ncustomer attrition, which is constantly on the rise, for their Savings Account\\nproduct.

The algorithms will read the data and find out patterns leading to attrition behavior based on previous account closures. It will then leverage this learning on newly available customer information in the current scenario and predicts the probability of attrition.', 'I came across an astounding project predicting customer propensity to buy retail banking products 10 years from today! Guess what was the driving feature in these algorithms? That’s right, current educational background and achievements tracked on business social media websites lead to understanding where the person would want to park their money in the future.', 'One very interesting use of Natural Language Processing algorithms like Naïve Bayes classifier in retail banking is into analyzing transactions. Each transaction is associated with a code and a short description. Data scientists use language parsing to extract keywords or tokens from the humongous text generated to read through the description and discover more about the transaction. It can be identified whether you have paid for a product at a retail store, transferred money to another bank account that you hold or paid the bill of a credit card from another bank. The transactions can be then linked to how you value your current relationship with the bank and the business can decide upon various customer outreach strategies based on this critical information.', 'They buy what they see', ' ', 'According to the laws of economics, choices spoil us. The more the options in front of customers, the more confused they become and the more chances of not buying the product. A very niche field that makes use of hardcore machine learning algorithms is Targeted Digital Marketing, and retail banking is constantly using this to identify and catch potential customers visiting the website by displaying customized web content which caters to the needs of visitors and offer products they are looking for. How does the business know what the customer wants? Digital Footprints!', 'Millions of website visitors generate thousands of GBs of data that contain information such as what channel they come from, which is the most frequent landing page on the bank’s website, which pages they scan through, how much time they spend reading the content, how many unique visits they make per day or week etc. This data is called the Digital Footprint of a website visitor, also called Clickstream Data. Banking and financial institutions have been churning this data to generate accurate information about what exactly the visitor is looking for, and they efficiently display customized content to the visitors with products that they would be interested in displayed on the home page. This prompts the visitor to click on the display link and understand more about the product, as the saying goes, they buy what they see. You should not display too much content altogether as it will confuse the visitor and they might log off without making any deal, or without leaving their information to be contacted later. The information from digital footprints can be customized to the extent of what % rate the visitor would convert on! Customized content is displayed based on which current visitors show characteristics of other visitors in the past who got converted. Since the conversion rate is minimal as only a few out of millions of visitors on the bank’s website actually buy a product or service online, we need to use some very powerful machine learning algorithms that can catch the pattern with the limited amount of data to learn on. Also, there is a huge amount of data that needs to be read through by the algorithm as digital footprints get generated with each second. Machine Learning algorithms such as Random Forest (which use Bagging methodology) or Gradient Boosting (which use Boosting methodology) come to the rescue. These algorithms are efficient in handling huge amount of data and can identify patterns with good accuracy. Data Scientists also use a technique called Stacking where outputs of different algorithms are combined and fed into another model to calculate probability as a combination of various machine learning algorithms.', 'So, the next time you visit a bank’s website and pop-up displays offering an attractive interest rate on the home loan, be assured that a heavily loaded machine learning algorithm running in the background has monitored your activity on the website and knows what you are looking for.

Our approach was to define loyalty based on three metrics: recency of transactions, frequency of transactions and the monetary value of transactions (better known as RFM model in analytics world). These three metrics combined, with a certain weight assigned to each one based on what is more important to the business, enable us to rank which customers are interacting more as compared to others (who eventually are dormant and fall in not so loyal category). An important consideration is to study the transactions in depth otherwise errors might creep in. For instance, and this is very interesting, when we developed the categories based on RFM score, we saw every single savings account holder scored very high on recency value. This was very intriguing for us and we spent days in identifying what was happening, only to later realize that every savings account has an interest receivable by the account holder, and it credits to the account at the end of each month. The trade-offs of being too technical I suppose.', 'The second instance was when the business wanted to identify bank branches that have lower than average performance, on metrics like new customers acquired, average balances maintained in accounts, quality of home loan applications sent to head branch for approval, promoter score of customers, employee attrition, etc. Using k-means clustering, we identified and differentiated all the high performing branches on these metrics from the lower ones. This helped the bank in taking decisions like reviewing the financial targets for lower performing branches or provide focus on employee training, and also incentivize the high performing branches to inspire others.', 'The core idea behind all advanced analytics and data science algorithms is to help the business make better decisions faster.

Another such example is in the state of Odisha, where LPG distribution center was opened in areas, which needed them the most and not where LPG companies see the most demand that was done using geospatial analytics. Also, many not-for-profit development organizations like, Swaniti initiative is working on innovative projects on analyzing data for the Indian government. They collect, analyze, and visualize data, which is used to design the development programs. They partnered with the Andhra Pradesh CM’s office to provide the data insights on agriculture that helped design a seed dissemination program.', 'So our political leaders can play an important role in providing effective governance if they leverage these new technologies. Adoption of these big data and analytics can play a major role in the overall development of society. These political leaders can take advantage of the power of IT infrastructure in their respective areas and can use the technology of big data to bring in transparency and accountability in governance. There are many other government institutions and departments like the Income-tax department that can use data analytics to scan through income and expenditure patterns of tax return filers and use it to detect black money generation. Similarly, such tools can also be used to detect terror and crime financing by analyzing the pattern of transactions being done through respective accounts. As tax collection is the major source of income for the government, they can strengthen the IT department with these technologies to counter the tax evasion problems faced by the government and trace the loopholes in the system. Also, they can create a team of data scientists for several departments of government to keep track of functions and administrations so that everyone can come under the lens of performance check with data-based results. Artificial Intelligence-based systems can be used for fraud detection in several government institutions and hence can act upon that also within time to avoid further setbacks.', 'Another example where these systems can be used extensively are in the areas of land and property holding records to detect fraud and forging of documents as most of the documents related to properties are still paper-based, hence it needs to be strengthened through advanced big data and analytics systems to keep a proper track record. Also, it can be used in our judicial system to track the number of pending cases as well as important cases that have been pending for a long time and yet not resolved. Further, it can be used for tracking the healthcare facilities and monitoring their performance through artificial intelligence and data analytics like what is the quality of treatment and facilities being offered to the people in these state-run hospitals and whether the government spending on healthcare is actually utilized or not effectively.', 'Now, these things can be achieved if these political leaders try to inculcate the data-driven decision-making practices in their processes. For this, first, they need to invest more in setting up more data warehouses so that data can be collected and stored as well as bring more data scientists to work on these areas so that administration can be monitored in real-time and government can function on data-based results. As the government spends lots of money on several schemes for public welfare, the effectiveness of these schemes plays a major role in helping society also. Also, the government can partner with several institutions as well as companies working in these fields to provide solutions as well as collaborative research can be done to find the solutions for these real-world problems. Many political parties had already used data analytics in their electoral campaign program to understand the voter stance of a particular demographic and have campaigned accordingly, which has resulted in a better outcome for the electoral results, for example, the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was a prime example of using data-driven techniques for electoral campaigning. So the political leaders also now understand the benefits of using these technologies in decision making and hence if they create an infrastructure to use it on a larger scale in day-to-day governance, a lot of work can be fast-tracked and hence, ease them in administration also. Today, perhaps India owns the largest data repository in the world gathered via digitalization of records for purposes like Aadhaar Card, passports, pan card, Kisan credit card, etc. There is a massive amount of data that government has and if they use it positively then there is a lot of opportunities to apply this data to improve the citizens’ service experience and government efficiency, especially in the delivery of services to the common people.', 'This can also be applied to the farming sector, whereby water demand can be predicted in needy areas having a higher reliance on agriculture and producing in large amounts. Water supply problems soon can also be predicted. Data analytics can be used to get farmers a better price for their agricultural produce by producing crops having higher expected demand or avoiding crops which will have higher failure probability. In the education sector, it can be used to predict the demand for the number of schools, teachers, reading materials, etc. in areas where these facilities are not in reach and their performance can also be monitored by the respective district departments.', 'So basically these technologies have a wide application in major areas like healthcare, education, transportation, agriculture, etc. and if implemented can lead to positive results in the near future in terms of better governance. But this needs to be done with proper planning and proper channels as data security is also a big concern and a data warehouse has the huge challenge of cybersecurity issues because, in case of the data breach, all the data could be affected and might lead to misuse of the data. So if our political parties could leverage these technologies in their respective areas, the benefit is huge and can help them in achieving better governance as well as greater accountability to the people.', 'Blackcoffer Insights 8.0: Abhishek Kumar & Joydeep Datta, IIM Visakhapatnam'])\n",

The presence of multiple platforms, microbloggers, and hundreds of social media websites has changed the dynamics of the pit completely.', 'Data analytics was a buzzword during Barack Obama’s election campaigns in 2008 and 2012. It is also believed that predictive models and extensive analysis of the data of US citizens helped him turn the tides in his favor in 2012. US elections post 2012 saw a decrease in traditional advertising expenditure from 93% to less than 50%. These elections also saw a man with no political experience take the reins of the most powerful country in the world. Cambridge Analytica (infamously known for harvesting data from Facebook) was awarded the research-focused, ARF Ogilvy awards in the following year and the dependence of the world on data analytics was reiterated. Elections are not just campaigns based on sentiments, hunches, and popular opinions; instead, influencers and digital trends lead the way in swaying masses to favor an electoral candidate.', 'Big data is considered to be empowering for political leaders. When a political leader decides to contest an election; he has terabytes of data on what opinion people have of him, what is expected of the next leader, how many people might vote for him, and most importantly what are the most pressing concerns in the society.', 'Extensive data mining and collecting data after every event has given political leaders an opportunity to adopt a modular approach and voice a different concern to different people. This has reduced the number of misfires significantly. Through analytics, political leaders and their research teams have been able to categorize the entire population on the basis of psychographic segmentation.', 'These segmentations have enabled political leaders to include personalized and tailor-made strategies to be more closely affiliated with people. Every word that a political leader says is backed by algorithms which makes the delivery impeccable. This unparalleled precision is what draws political leaders to adopt data-based campaigns. Social media content is now being altered accordingly as well. People with similar political interests would find similar content on social media. This content would be coherent to their interests which ensures that the user is bound to read it. When a common man is checking his notifications for early morning updates, he is being targeted by the research team of a political campaign without him realizing it.', 'Campaigns have limited financial resources. When the resources are limited, information such as the amount of contact required for a particular constituency and which population to target can help in the effective utilization of resources. A political leader can recognize constituencies that could swing either way or the ones which are a lost cause and effectively manage resources to produce favorable results.', 'Analytics firms collect huge amounts of data. Algorithms are used which reveal trends, opinions, and other patterns that would have required door-to-door campaigning a few decades ago. This data also includes an analysis of social media websites. The firm uses this data to predict outcomes based on the coherency of opinions of the people with that of a political leader. The task at hand for the political leader now would be to convert more people in his favor. Data will give reports of the constituencies where the vote might swing in either way. The leader capitalizes on these areas. Micro-targeting potential voters were widely used during Obama’s campaign of 2012. This included specific TV advertisements and tailor-made social media messages to influence people. These customized campaigns have helped many leaders and their use is becoming more prominent.', 'While on one side everything seems bright; the use of big data raises some serious concerns as well. One of the biggest concerns that have been raised is the issue of data privacy. Accurate analysis requires huge volumes of good quality data. It is claimed that most of the data gathered are through primary research (surveys, polls, etc.). Primary research has its limitations and there is always a risk of data being highly skewed. It has been accused that most of the data usually being gathered is secondary research data under the guise of primary data. \\xa0Cambridge Analytica was accused of using personal data of American citizens through Facebook while it was working for state senator Ted Cruz. Scandals like these raise serious concerns about the misuse of ones’ data by political leaders. Data manipulation is another concern that has affected elections. Accusations were made on Russian hackers for manipulating US presidential elections by accessing research data and private emails of electoral candidates. Though these are just accusations it does not deny the fact that it might be a possibility in the future.', 'While data has empowered political leaders, it is on them on how they choose to utilize this information. A leader can choose to hide his personal opinions and intended agendas just to maintain consistency with the masses or intentionally design a manifesto which portrays him as the most ideal candidate. Amplification of malpractices which the authorities might not be able to detect in due time is a serious concern.', 'While data is enlightening, statistical use of human preferences and equating human lives to pointers being justified is certainly food for thought. Big data and analytics is a double-edged sword whose effectiveness will continue to bring more political leaders towards it and for now, the bonus of using it appropriately remains with the leaders, but the incentive to misuse it is fairly high.', 'Blackcoffer Insights 8.0: Shubham Sabharwall, IIM Kashipur'])\n",

Currently, the oil price is hovering around $70/barrel. Events such as these force the O&G companies to restructure their upstream, midstream and downstream operations. Refinery shutdowns, handling various grades of crude oil, and changing environmental regulations are pushing gross refining margins down to a bare minimum. With the use of IoT, refineries can plan their shutdowns, minimize their downtime, and improve safety record. In fact, refineries that have incorporated IoT in their operations are known as Smart Refineries. IoT is the next step in the evolution of the oil and gas industry. It will play a significant role in lower operating expenses and increase the reliability of the complete production plant. O&G companies around the world are now focussing on IoT to increase overall efficiency and decrease non-productive time as well as costs. Basically, IoT covers the entire value chain of the Oil and Gas industry right from pinpointing the location and exploration of oil wells to refining crude oil to the transportation of oil through pipelines and trucks. From the trillions of dollars that are spent every year on exploration and production (E&P), a very small investment in IoT will reap huge benefits to the entire chain of petroleum operations.', 'Preventative Maintenance (PM)', 'The O&G industry loses billions of dollars every year due to non-productive time (NPT). IoT could be used to help reduce NPT events by using real-time data to predict breakdowns and schedule preventative maintenance. This in itself is a huge field of application of IoT. Preventive maintenance (PM) is continuously monitoring certain parameters of the equipment, like vibration, temperature, oil levels and those parameters which are critical to the operation of the equipment, through sensors. The sensors continuously relay real-time data to the receiver. Due to this, the management can accurately determine when there is need of maintenance and the time spent on repairing the machine after it is broken down as well as the greater losses that the organization had to face due to production losses are completely eliminated. In the O&G sector, PM can be used for pumps, compressors, heat exchangers, steam traps, relief valves and all those equipment where doing instrumentation is expensive and difficult and failure of these will lead to high monetary losses. Billions of dollars in savings have been achieved by industries that incorporated IoT in their plants for PM. The Petropiar refinery (Chevron/PDVSA joint venture) in Mejorador Jose, Barcelona, Venezuela, installed predictive management software in conjunction with 4,500 HART field instruments. Using these technologies enabled the refinery to increase production, reduce costs, and improve profitability.', '[1]', 'Smart Pipelines', 'Pipelines form the transportation backbone of the O&G industry. For a refinery, there are pipeline networks which scale thousands of kilometers, through rugged lands and mountains caring for the black gold. 24*7 maintenance and supervision of pipelines, in terms of theft, leaks, and corrosion, is very important but with such a huge network this is not possible using wired technology. A pipeline leak will cause oil to leak at a very high flow rate due to the high-pressure differential created and hence immediate leak detection plays a critical role. IoT along with supervisory control and data acquisition(SCADA) plays an immensely important role here. Represented here is the Schneider Electric and Cisco “Smart Connected Pipeline”. It is an open, end-to-end solution for pipeline management that provides future-ready communication architectures for integrated, automated pipeline operations through the use of modern IT technologies', '[2]', '.', 'IoT has enabled companies to save millions of dollars in oil losses due to pipeline leaks or theft.', 'Asset Management to increase operational efficiency', 'A typical petrochemical industry has millions of equipment both large and small and hence it is an asset-intensive industry. The assets can range from Pressure Relief Valves (PRVs) to Heat Exchangers (HE) to huge Distillation Columns (DC). Identifying the efficient working of the larger equipment is easy as all the important parameters like temperature, pressure, flow, and level are wired to the DCS. It is a failure of the smaller equipment that goes unnoticed which over a period of time leads to operational inefficiency. When this smaller equipment is fitted with sensors and transformed into a thing that can send data to the cloud system we get real-time analysis of the complete operation and can quickly identify as to what the issue is.', 'A classic example of asset management for a very critical but non-instrumented part is Emerson’s Process Management’s successful implementation of IoT at Denka Singapore Pte Ltd., a subsidiary of Denka chemical company and one of the world’s largest facilities for continuous polymerizationSteam is a very important heating utility at Denka. As the steam travels through pipes it keeps on condensing after exchanging heat with the concerned process fluid and becomes condensate. This along with non-condensable gases has to be removed and that is done by steam traps. An incorrectly operating steam trap results in lower heating efficiency and escape of live steam; and with industry studies showing steam-trap failure rate in the region of 20% a year (Denka’s was 17%), and given hundreds or even thousands of steam traps in the typical facility, the cost consequences associated with failure are significant', '[3]', '. Denka’s approach towards the correction of steam traps was like other process facilities, manual checking by a contractor on an annual basis. This caused a large amount of steam to go waste which created financial as well as energy loss.', 'To automate the laborious process of steam trap monitoring and provide far more frequent updates on the health of steam traps in the Denka plant, Emerson Process Managementarchitected and deployed a native IoT solution. At the equipment level, to sense (i.e. listen for) steam leakage, Emerson’s Rosemount 708 wireless acoustic transmitters configured on a WirelesHART mesh network are attached to 148 of the most critical (high pressure, high capacity) steam traps in the facility. Data collected at the WirelessHART gateways are then transmitted via local telecom provider’s Singtel’s 3G cellular network to analytics software (hosted on a Microsoft Azure cloud platform) for generation of steam trap performance reports4. The acoustic patterns of the condensate are different than the acoustic pattern of steam. It is this change that the sensor monitors and reports.', 'Some of the most fascinating facts about this IoT solution are:', 'No involvement with the plant DCS thus alleviating the common concerns of interference and security with the DCS.', 'Implementation of the IoT solution is simplified as there is no connection with DCS.', 'The complete system software, as well as sensors, is provided at no upfront capital but at a monthly service fee thus the capital expenditure is replaced by the operational expenditure.', 'The steam traps are not analyzed at Denka but at Emerson’s Sensing Regional Centre, thus creating no additional burden on Denka.', 'Creation of a weekly extension report which contains details of the failed steam traps needing replacement.', 'Creation of a monthly savings report containing information of the steam leakage and equivalent financial loss.', 'After implementing this solution the steam trap failure rate went down from 22% to less than 10% and steam consumption decreased by 7% which will directly impact on increasing the company’s bottom line.', 'Smarter Oilfield Operations', '\\n', '\\n', 'This is an example, of smart operations for a leading O&G service provider, taken from Cognizant. The client wanted to increase efficiency and reduce operational costs for thousands of Electric Submersible Pumps (ESPs). ESPs are lowered into boreholes to provide artificial lift when the underground pressure is too weak to force oil to the surface. The engineer needs to periodically reset each pump’s motor speed to optimize production. This depends on the good conditions, such as pressure, viscosity, as well as market prices. Historically, reprogramming the pump profile requires dispatching an engineer to the oilfield, which is not only a waste of time but also a costly proposition that sometimes requires helicopter travel to a dangerous land or sea location.', '\\n', 'Cognizant began optimizing the problem by conducting an end-to-end analysis of all current systems and processes, identifying opportunities to optimize software, hardware, and processes regarding ESPs. Based on the analysis, Cognizant engineers developed an IoT solution to efficiently gather sensor information, analyze it to determine optimal ESP settings, and program those settings over the network. Using the pump software developed by Cognizant, the client’s engineers could recalibrate pumps over the network, like adjusting motor speed according to the data generated by the software with just a few clicks, instead of traveling to remote oilfields. This can be done for a lot of pumps at the same time thus maximizing the utilization of the oilfield as well as reducing costs. The same interface enables engineers to configure rules to prevent equipment failure — for example, by shutting down equipment when drill temperature reaches 100 degrees and resuming when the temperature falls to 90 degrees', '[4]', '. Based on the software the client also received alerts about impending pump failures, thus enabling him to take preventative measures before the pump fails. The repair work is much faster and unplanned breakdowns have reduced thus increasing the productive time as well as customer satisfaction.

When considering protein interaction networks, we are interested in the role a particular protein plays in the overall network.', 'In terms of methodology, addressing simultaneously the global scale community problem (in social networks) and the local scale role problem (in protein networks) remains an open question. But, by addressing each problem separately, efficient methods can be devised. Therefore, the research question must focus on one of the two aspects: either local or global.', 'The incompatibility of the two approaches is due to the very different mathematical tools used to address both problems. For community detection, the network is regarded as a large matrix, and tools usually rely on the\\xa0', 'eigenvectors', '\\xa0of\\xa0that matrix.', 'On the other hand, to determine the role of each node, the network is considered as a graph and the occurrence of small shapes around a given node are enumerated. The former being algebraic in nature, and the later combinatorial in nature, it is not straightforward to articulate the two approaches in a single method.', 'One set of tools is needed to identify what community a given agent belongs to, and another to describe the role of a given agent. However, there isn’t a tool that does both. As a consequence, it is necessary to decide which of the two aspects is to be studied in advance.', '\\n', 'A threefold challenge', '\\n', 'Like other sectors like healthcare, retail, capital market, energy and many more, academia sees the potential of big data.

Proper retail inventory management, which helps to balance supply and demand, relies heavily on an accurate forecast of future demand. In fact, sales forecasting refers to predicting future demand (or sales), assuming that the factors which affected demand in the past and are affecting the present will still have an influence in the future. It is an important task but is very difficult to accomplish.', 'In the retailing industry, which is defined as the retailing business of products including apparel, shoes, and fashion beauty products, forecasting itself can be treated like a “service” which represents the set of analytical tools that facilitate the companies to make the best decisions for predicting the future. Undoubtedly, a good forecasting service system can help to avoid understocking or over-stocking in retail inventory planning, which further relates to other critical operations of the whole supply chain such as due date management, production planning, pricing, and achieving high customer service level. In order to achieve economics sustainability under a highly competitive environment, a company should adopt a consumer-demand driven “pull” operational strategy which means forecasting becomes a critically important task.', 'Compared to other retailing service industries, it is well argued that sales forecasting is a very difficult task in fashion retailing because fashion product’s demand is highly volatile with the ever-changing taste of the consumers and the fashion product’s life cycle is very short. In addition, the sales of fashion products are strongly affected “stochastically” by seasonal factors, fashion trend factors, and many tricky variables (e.g., weather, marketing strategy, political climate, item features, and macroeconomic trend). These, together with the fact that fashion retailers are carrying a large number of stock-keeping units (SKUs) with limited historical sales data, all make sales forecasting challenging and call for more sophisticated and versatile analytical tools. On the other hand, it is known that the fashion apparel supply chain is a relatively long one which includes upstream cotton plants, fiber manufacturers, apparel factories, distributors, wholesalers, and retailers. As a consequence, the notorious bullwhip effect will have a particularly strong influence on the fashion supply chain. Since forecasting is a critical factor relating to the presence and significance of the bullwhip effect, improving forecasting can help reduce the bullwhip effect which directly enhances the efficiency of the fashion supply chain.', 'Statistical Fashion Sales Forecasting Methods', 'Traditionally, fashion sales forecasting is accomplished by statistical methods. In fact, a lot of statistical methods have been used for sales forecasting, which includes linear regression, moving average, weighted average, exponential smoothing (used when a trend is present but not linear), exponential smoothing with the trend, double exponential smoothing, Bayesian analysis, and so forth.', 'Statistical time series analysis tools such as ARIMA and SARIMA are widely employed in sales forecasting. Since these methods have a closed form expression for forecasting, it is simple and easy to implement and the results can be computed very quickly.', 'AI Fashion Retail Sales Forecasting Methods', 'The pure statistical models have a deficiency in conducting fashion retail forecasting, in order to improve forecasting accuracy. AI methods emerge with the advance of computer technology. In fact, AI models can efficiently derive “arbitrarily nonlinear” approximation functions directly from the data. Popular methods such as artificial neural network (ANN) models and fuzzy logic models are commonly employed in the literature and they are the first kind of models being employed for fashion retail sales forecasting. To be specific, ANN models have been developed and they provide satisfactory results in different domains.', 'Hybrid Methods for Fashion Sales Forecasting', 'Hybrid forecasting methods are usually developed based on the fact that they can utilize the strengths of different models together to form a new forecasting method. As such, many of them are considered to be more efficient than pure statistical models and pure AI models. It is not surprising that in recent years, a number of research works examine hybrid forecasting methods. Hybrid methods employed in the fashion forecasting literature often combine different schemes such as fuzzy model, ANN, and ELM with other techniques such as statistical models, the grey model (GM), and so forth. Following are more adapted hybrid methods:', 'Fuzzy Logic Based Hybrid Methods', 'Neural Network Based Hybrid Methods', 'ELM Based Hybrid Methods', 'Applications in the Fashion Industry', 'Sales forecasting is a real-world problem in fashion retailing. From the perspective on applications and implementation, various issues are identified.', 'In terms of the forecasting horizon, most of the existing forecasting models are suitable for middle-term and long-term forecasting. However, short-term forecasting, including the very short term forecasting such as real-time forecasting, is not yet fully explored. This kind of short-term forecasting is very important given the nature of the fashion industry (the fashion trend is unpredictable, and the lead time is very short).', '\\n', 'Regarding the product type to be forecasted, two kinds of products are involved, namely, the existing product and a new product. Compared to the existing products forecasting, prediction on new product forecasting seems to be much more complicated and difficult, due to the absence of historical sales data.', '\\n', 'In terms of speed, in general, statistical methods can output the forecasting results very quickly. AI methods are usually more time-consuming. In the past, the lead time in the fashion industry is a bit longer than now, and the lead time can be ten months or even one year. However, the fashion industry has changed and fast fashion companies like ', 'ZARA', ', ', 'H&M', ', and ', 'Mango', ' are adopting quick response strategy with a very short lead time (e.g., 2 weeks in Zara for some products). As a result, forecasting result must be available within a very short time for any forecasting application for these companies.', '\\n'])\n",

Existing perimeter security solutions and end-system security are not effectively devised to handle insider attack and data exfiltration. Issues such as misconfiguration, vulnerable points, and covert network channels lead to data-exfiltration. Hence, building an effective system for detecting insider attacks remains an open challenge. Devising an exclusive behavior-based model is essential to detect data-exfiltration over the network by utilizing parameters from both system and network.', '2.\\xa0Motivation', 'Nowadays thousands of companies and organizations have been subject to a cyber-attack. Many hackers that exist outside of a company or an organization hacking and breaking into information systems to execute these cyber-attacks. But nowadays insiders that are hackers exist inside of a company or an organization are becoming a big problem and insiders are often overloaded as potential threats to commit cyber-attack.', 'Usually we apply some kind of security policies and access control policies which are aimed to prevent our data, business policy, product information, secret information, etc. but still sometimes it fails, because when we trust someone and give him/her full access to network, host, etc., they usually try to leak our data or information. This is the reason that we say, insider attacks are often more damaging and costly due to the knowledge of and access to information system. From the recent survey done by many institutions and researchers in 2010 and 2011, we know that more than a quarter of cyber-attacks were done by insiders.', '3. Insider Threat', 'An insider threat is a malicious hacker (also called a cracker or a black hat) who is an employee or officer of a business, institution, or agency. Insider threats are often disgruntled employees or ex-employees who believe that the business, institution, or agency has “done them wrong” and feel justified in gaining revenge.', 'It is difficult to detect and prevent, attacks by people with legitimate access to an organization’s computers and networks represent a growing problem in our digital world. These insider threats frustrate employers who lack the resources to identify them and monitor their behavior. Insiders are not just employees: today they can include contractors, business partners, auditors… even an alumnus with a valid email address.', 'Define an insider as a trusted entity that is given the power to violate a security policy. The insider is determined in reference to an established security policy. Insider threat lies in the access and ability to: violate a security policy using legitimate access and violate an access control policy by obtaining unauthorized access.', '4. Insider Type', 'There are different types of insiders that result in information leakage: Inadvertent, Intentional and Malicious. An inadvertent insider is a trusted person with access to sensitive information who inadvertently discloses sensitive information. An intentional insider is a trusted person who knowingly discloses sensitive information and is aware of the security that it is purposefully bypassing. This person may try to manipulate the content or use overt communication that preserves privacy to avoid detection. A malicious insider is also a trusted person who knowingly discloses sensitive information. However, in addition to manipulating the content or using overt communication like an international insider, tunneled or covert communication is usually employed to avoid detection.', '5. Data-Exfiltration', 'If we talk in terms of our general life, exfiltrate means to surreptitiously move personnel or material out an area under enemy control. In terms of computer science, data exfiltration is the unauthorized removal of data from a network. E.g. leakage of archives, passwords, additional malware and utilities, personally identifiable information, financial data, trade secrets, source code, intellectual property, etc. For a hacker, it is easy to move things in a box. E.g. RAR file, ZIP file, CAB file, etc. Data Exfiltration via outbound FTP, HTTPS is most common these days. Data-Exfiltration through Network medium is most common. For example, FTP, HTTP, SMTP, SSH, INSTANT MESSENGER, ROOTKITS, BATNETS, SPYWARE, COVERT CHANNELS, PHISHING, PHARMING, MITM are the medium by which data-exfiltration is quite simple for insider. Exploits, Privilege escalation, DNS Poisoning, Directory traversal are common attack done by an insider. If we talk about Physical medium of data-exfiltration is also play a major role.

This differs from cryptography, where there is no intention to camouflage the transmission of data, but rather the goal is to make the data readable/useable solely to the receiver. The oldest form of a covert channel is steganography, where the intention is to avoid drawing suspicion to the transmission of a hidden message.', 'Source:\\xa0https://urlzs.com/GiJX', 'Covert channels evolved from tattooing messages on a slaves scalp to embedding information into features of the TCP/IP protocol. Although a formal definition of covertness in the field of computer science does not exist, research on the detection of covert communication is very active. Informally, we can say that an operation is more covert if it is difficult to detect without the use of special tools that specifically look for it.', 'For example, let us suppose that we want to detect a user who is printing documents on a particular printer over the network (for convenience, we will refer to such a user simply as John). Suppose that we do not set up any network tools to keep records of any communication between John’s workstation and the printer. The only way to detect if John prints something is to see if he walks to the printer to pick up the page. Alternatively, we may detect that every time we try to print something, we discover that the printer is frequently busy and that John is waiting for his print jobs to complete. If John wants to keep the operation hidden he should just print at a lower rate, say one page per day. Nobody would detect it. If instead he keeps printing all day long, at the highest possible rate, the operation becomes easily recognizable. Even printing at half the maximum rate makes the process quite noticeable.', 'If we abstract this concept, we obtain the following: Covertness is a characteristic of an operation that can be measured by the rate of usage of the media. If the apparatus is exploited at its maximum capacity, the operation is easily visible with a covertness of zero; if instead it is exploited at a lesser rate, the operation will be increasingly covert. In other words, a measure of covertness is some function of distance from the capacity for a given medium. Therefore, to keep activity as covert as possible, the rate of usage, compared to the capacity of the equipment, should be kept as low as possible.', 'The closer the capacity is to the rate at which the operation or transmission is executed, the more covert the transmission will be.

However, the cost of doing business, as well as the risk, has gone up significantly, with vendors not having access to wholesale markets and suppliers and having to spend more on travel costs due to travel restrictions in place in the city. Also, with the lockdown still partially in place, the number of buyers has gone down and so have earnings. Due to the harsh summer heat, perishable fruits and vegetables also have a reduced shelf life so vendors are unable to capitalize on whatever produce they do have.', 'The state has recently announced a\\xa0stimulus package of INR 5000 crore for nearly 50 lakh vendors, acknowledging the grave impact of their loss of livelihood. The intended relief for vendors will be a credit loan that will provide an initial working capital of INR 10,000 for all vendors, but this is not sufficient. Instead of credit, the government should think of converting it into direct income benefit, a cash grant, as livelihood support to start the income activity regularly. The vendors need income support to be able to restart work, and if they are not able to do so, how will they return the loan. In the face of the ever-changing crisis, vendor organizations have to step forward and advocate for vendors to be provided the resources they need to be able to resume their livelihoods. To this end, vendors organizations could consider the following for an advocacy agenda:', 'Livelihood promotion for all vendors, including those selling non-essential goods: The impact of COVID-19 has been very harsh on informal workers who have exhausted their capital and earnings in trying to feed themselves during the extended lockdown period. Vendors need to be able to resume vending for survival and the government should take steps to begin to reopen markets and allow vendors back on the streets.', 'Reopening of Markets keeping in mind social distancing and hygiene: Delhi has many different types of traditionally crowded markets including weekly markets (for fresh food, cooked food and essential household items) and daily markets that operate on the sides of roads. These markets will need to resume keeping in mind the need for social distancing and the government should release guidelines for the same. Going forward, vending zones must also be designed keeping in mind the need for social distancing and for sufficient hygiene facilities (running water, washing stations and toilets). The authorities should work with Town Vending Committees (TVCs) for the same.', 'Provide direct support which is de-linked from existing registration requirements: As lockdown is lifted and vending resumes, vendors who have been at home for months will need direct income benefits to resume their work. The government stimulus package, while a welcome step, is insufficient in the nature of relief (credit not direct cash transfer) and eligibility (only registered vendors are eligible, which leaves out the majority of vendors in the country). In addition, government relief and support needs to be de-linked from very rigid registration requirements, as very few vendors have been registered in India. In Delhi, out of roughly 300,000 street vendors, only about 131,00 have some form of occupational identification. If the criteria for any kind of cash grant or livelihood support is linked to occupational identification by the state, then the government should also accept registration with a workers’ organisation/union as a proxy for government-issued vending passes.', 'Ensuring hygiene and social distancing at sites of vending: The government needs to take steps for provision of running water and soap/sanitisers for street vendors at their place of work. Additionally, vendor organisations should work with food safety authorities in the country to train vendors (especially cooked food vendors) in ways to maintain hygiene while working.', 'Taking steps to survey and register more vendors for access to government benefits: As mentioned earlier, the number of vendors who have some form of identification are a fraction of the actual population of vendors in Delhi. Before the crisis and subsequent lockdown, the Town Vending Committees (TVCs) were supposed to start surveying and registering vendors.
